No fingerprint screen sensor is present;;negative;;;
Ugliest phone from apple i ever seen good job apple.;;;;;negative
Dont forget to add 1000 eur price.;;;negative;;
Expected lot more from this phone but apple is every year the same with minimum differences. I am glad i am not an apple user any more.;;negative;;;
Useless phone, unless you only need a camera.;negative;;;;
The ugliest iphone design. Period.;;;;;negative
For the first time apple is not winning in the looks department;;;;;negative
Hahahahahahahahaha 1000 Euros phone without Fast Charging, good luck then;;negative;negative;;
Only facial recognition ID? screw that.. No way am i passing out drunk at a party and people just.. Whoop.. hold up ma phone;;negative;;;
facial recognition sucks. in the demo, the guy flopped doing it;;negative;;;
I am still happy with iPhone 6s Plus I am disappointed with the this years launch as well I don't think there is any changes in the iOS 11 as well;;negative;;;
So the iPhone X looks exactly as the leaks, which is unfortunate. It shares the title of ugliest phone on the market with the iPhone 8.;;;;;negative
Amazing super design;;;;;positive
this phone looks awesome i dont care what anybody wanna say great job apple;positive;;;;positive
thanks, apple. this year apple really has done a good job;positive;;;;
this year I'm gonna buy this beast. really good job;positive;;;;
lol, they call it bezel less, yet note 8 and s8 plus have better screen-to-body ratio. and those side bezels are just ugly;;;;;negative
In my iPhone 6 when I double tap the home button, it brings the screen down so I can reach the area in the upper part with one hand. I think this feature is missing in iPhone X. This is so bad specially it has a bigger screen now and working with one hand with it will be impossible without this feature. If they can make it done by double tap the lock button or squeeze the phone sides it will be great. Hope so.;;negative;;;
Am i the only one who actually sees the bezels? They are Huge af!!! and no fingerprint under screen? yeah sure i give AROUND 1150euro for this! 10x apple... sucked even more!;;negative;negative;;negative
So much talking and nothing new... Bye Apple.;;negative;;;
This the best smartphone ever with the best and most secure iOS;positive;positive;;;
"Look at that ugly camera ; looks like traffic lights . The ugliest phone ever . Gzzz";;;;negative;negative
When i first saw the look i just thought it was fan made but when i actually found out it was official i was so disappointed. I'm against the bezel less phones especially when they come out looking as bad as this;;;;;negative
That is the ugliest phone ever made.;;;;;negative
No fingerprint in screen? Sad;;negative;;;
With the most outrageous price ever. If you guys will still buy this phone at over $1,000 then you guys really have your life priorities messed up.;;;negative;;
to my eyes, this iphone is looking not as good as many androids out there. the only thing that keeps this phone from android is the software experience;;positive;;;negative
i love this phone;positive;;;;
Although I'm die hard android I will say I think they have done a good job with the X;positive;;;;
This is the most ugly phone i have ever seen.;;;;;negative
The phone is ugly, no one said anything about ios;;;;;negative
Looks like a cheap phone from china;;;;;negative
awesome;positive;;;;
I like how they made something that already exists on the market and improved it something unique with their knowledge and also how they simplify the process..My only concern is that it doesn't come out in black;positive;positive;;;
Well said and honest;positive;;;;
"Grapes are sure! my friend; this is the best phone in the world ever.";positive;;;;
That would be great;positive;;;;
AWESOME! simply great. Great work.;positive;;;;
I'm not iPhone user or a fan.. iOS is very smooth and doesn't need much ram like android. It is well optimized. But apple could give more but they want to cut the cost everywhere and charge the most to take it the profit in large margin;;positive;negative;;
Realy back side camera to much ugly;;;;;negative
"one word for now, ""ugly""";;;;;negative
The not so essential phone. Horrible design. Nothing works in the looks department. From the proportions to the way the edges and screen blend into each other to the odd camera protrusion.;;;;;negative
no fingerprint waste of money;;negative;;;
I don't usually like iPhones, but this X changed my mind. At least only for this X. Thumbs up;positive;;;;
No finger print scanner, they claim that the new facial recognition is the the best option to go with;;negative;;;
no finger print scanner;;negative;;;
hmm it's look like a super expensive android to me with a bunch of gimmicks noting new ooh there is facial recognition to it but sadly it failed at presentation and it supports wireless charging hmm also fast charging i think it should have it coz we all know.;;negative;;;
One of the best of best phone it will be every thing that we whant now;positive;;;;
Super sharp oled display;;;;;positive
bezels less desgin;;;;;positive
higher price 64GB $999;;;;;positive
cameras are excellent;;;;positive;
wirless charging;;positive;;;
4K at 60fps;;positive;;;
Honestly.... I have never ever really liked Apple do to the fact their phones always look the same. ( in my opinion ), But I have to admit, this phone is pretty nice!!!! And looks stunning;;positive;;;positive
The new animoji feature is totally sick!!!! Just being able to custom adjust your emogi with your facial expressions is absolutely amazing!;;positive;;;
And last but not least: I am so happy Apple finally went wireless!;;positive;;;
Finally The Beast Revealed with well developed specs in Apple;;positive;;;
good front design and an odd looking back camera;;;;;positive
I love this X phone;positive;;;;
Pretty disappointed. Nothing amazing;negative;;;;
More innovation please. This phone does not set no future for phones. It is the same product as before. Nothing brilliantly amazing.;;negative;;;
Too expensive for the specs, you can find other phones at much cheaper price with higher specs. 3gb ram seriously? flagship device at only 3gb ram..still bad battery ..subpar design. Only goodthing I can say would probably the iOs software looks and performs better.;;negative;negative;;
That's what i don't like in new iphone as well. I think it is a mistake done by apple designers;;;;;negative
Everything looks pretty exciting but I hate to say that top portion the screen & fat black edges around the screen looks really ugly;positive;;;;negative
Ugly design!;;;;;negative
5,8 inch screen ?? is it a joke ? motorolla did 6 inch screen 3 years ago. the top of the screen is cut why ?;;;;;negative
still no dual sim :(;;negative;;;
The resolution screen is ridiculous.;;;;;negative
Without fingerprint scanner...... Worst iphone ever;;negative;;;
this is a great phone ever;positive;;;;
Best phone!!! No doubt. Perhaps will break all previous selling records. Well done Apple.;positive;;;;
finally, best phone for all iphones(using amoled etc)!!!... iphone x has the same feature as s8..;positive;positive;;;
Amazing acheivement Apple;positive;;;;
But its true iphone is best all the way;positive;;;;
IOS is best all the way;;positive;;;
Best smartphone currently iphone X;positive;;;;
The phone looks great, design is cool but why no fingerprint sensor ?? I didn't trust Face ID Recognition because in presentation the Iphone X Face ID didn't worked and the presenter use PIN Code to unlock the phone;;negative;;;positive
I really don't like that camera module design and that camera ugly bump and I didn't know how much battery will last.;;negative;;;negative
Great innovation on face recognition but screen looks weird while playing videos. Moreover, looks like overpriced.;positive;;negative;;negative
The ugly and annoying pop out back camera lens.;;;;;negative
The bad display cut at the top.;;;;;negative
The black strip around the display.;;;;;negative
Ugly Front design;;;;;negative
Ugly Camera;;;;;negative
I am impressed by iPhone X. But price is too damn high. Still I am looking forward to buy one.;positive;;negative;;
Brilliant device this time Apple did it again. Let´s see how it behaves on the reviews;positive;;;;
I'm skeptical about the future-proofing of this phone;negative;;;;
Disappointed, Nothing new in this phones;negative;;;;
This looks decent though, Just not enough to get me to switch;;;;;positive
Not even in octa core. What do we expect from this;;negative;;;
Ugly design, the iPhone 8 is better, this one is fat and weird.;;;;;negative
Nothing special about this phone, as always a lot of noise and blaba. Just the name you have to pay for.;negative;;;;
i think its a great new take on the design but i think it would have been better with at least the option of having the matte black or jet black colour;;;;;positive
I love the design of that thing. Its perfect size, flat screen and rounded stainless steel sides should make for a great in hands feeling and probably user experience. Would be buying one instantly if it was priced competively.;;;;;positive
An over priced junk has arrived again The iphone X . the touch id should have be there . for this price . 1150 bucks .;;;negative;;
Ugly screen compare 2 samsung edge series screen;;;;;negative
no finger id. face id some low light condetion not work perfectly. bad move apple;;negative;;;
iPhone X's gesture controls is the single most underrated feature nobody is talking about except for Michael Fisher aka Mr. Mobile. It's webOS reincarnated. Swipe up to close apps and carousel to the next ones will feel awesome!;;positive;;;
This is INNOVATION! Super AMOLED & Wireless charging! OMG Best PHONE EVER!! I love you apple thank you so much for these breathtaking novelty. I admire such innovative company. God bless you apple. Peace;;positive;;;positive
one thing that i realize in iphone is nothing but price;;;negative;;
Love the new iPhone X;positive;;;;
I love the classic iPhone design. More bling-bling under certain lighting conditions. The Apple logo on the back also looks much nicer with the white glass rear. You can barely recognize it on the darker one.;;;;;positive
Very disappointed..;negative;;;;
Great specs!;;positive;;;
I would really love to own one soon.. :-);positive;;;;
processor is an important in mobile phones. especially for internet and game. iPhone processor is very fast and good performance.;;positive;;;
It's so girly... but nice design :);;;;;positive
Huge side bezels;;;;;negative
Too High and costly for its cost over features. Iphone X is not worth that amount, its just costly for the hype of the brand apple iphone thats all.;;;negative;;
The iphone x is gorgeuos;;;;;positive
So... they finally caught up in some 2014 android features and added a bigger screen. Innovation!;;positive;;;
no fingerprint..... hahahahaha;;negative;;;
Its all perfect but the most disgusting part is at the top where the front cams are. Its really annoying especially when it comes to me because i have an OCD (symmetrical) i prefer the infinity display. And I think iPhone X is fragile and definitely i'm gonna freak out if I accidentally drop it. It's Costly right?;;;;;negative
It will fail because they don't have a fingerprint scanner and face unlock is inefficient and garbage.;;negative;;;
Maybe They aren't big innovators anymore But They still make great phones !;positive;;;;
This is the first Apple phone that caught my interest. Now I'll be saving some money for this phone :);positive;;;;
Only Face id just absurd.;;negative;;;
iPhone X is the best phone in the whole universe.;positive;;;;
it might not that ugly when u see it in front of you..as ppl who saw it in front of them, many of them say it is beautiful;;;;;positive
iPhone x very impressive in design and specifications. But tooo much expensive. the 256Gb one will cost more than C$1700 including tax in Canada. However i felt like there should've been a 128Gb instead of 64Gb.;;positive;negative;;positive
can't wait for this. omg going to be a long 2 months for me.;positive;;;;
ridiculously over priced!!!;;;negative;;
i like ios, and apple products, but this one is gross, its ok to pay a big price if its feature pack, but paying a big price just for a bezelless design? its gross, sorry apple, im not a sheep yet, waiting for next year again for some worthy phone to throw a $$$;;negative;negative;;
Most advanced and best smartphone ever made. This is the phone of the future. Others are looking like they came out of the stone age compared to this. Face recognition is the first ever and can never be duplicated. Super Retina Display is also the most advanced screen tech ever made. Wireless charging is also the first on a smartphone.;positive;positive;;;positive
In my country Apple products are really overpriced so this phone will be super Xpensive;;;negative;;
This phone looks interesting, its specs look very attractive, but it's not a device for small pockets and was never intended to be. I see there it's some kind of fashion to remove the middle button and extend the display. All right and fine, until we look at the display design, it looks like some kind of ass with those top display margins that show the status bar in the middle with the mic and camera.Again, it's expensive for what it brings.I say this especially by the display design and, of course, the 3.5 inch jack, that was never brought back.;;positive;;negative;negative
Awesome as ever.;positive;;;;
The phone is good. But the pricing is worst...;positive;;negative;;
No Finger print sensor. No headphone jack. Eeewww.;;negative;;;
Well, I think that this phone its really expensive;;;negative;;
Its not best smartphone;negative;;;;
this is worth to buy for me. i have the money to buy every apple product. its not hard to spend my money to buy apple products.;;;positive;;
Im still sceptical about the bezel. Hands on video shown that it is thicker than it seem. Or maybe it just the lighting. Does this really count as bezel less? The chassis is kinda fat too. Hmm. Hope they can improve the design next year. Just a little bit more. Seriously. Just a little tiny bit more improvement it can be perfect.;;;;;negative
I think face id is not a good idea for me. Because some people are very busy not aware of using or trying to look at with your phone while working or doing;;negative;;;
The best thing I like about this phone is the A11 Bionic Chipset. This is going to be miles ahead of all the other chipsets in the market. Really Apple, has kept itself ahead in the race by making sure that they own every technology that goes into making their phone. ;;positive;;;
My Dream Iphone!;positive;;;;
My only concern about the phone is that it looks ugly. In fact, all Apple's big phones aren't that good looking, but maybe the background of this phone makes it worse...;;;;;negative
Ridiculously overpriced and nothing new. except for the new built in apps which android users have been using since years. just a modified version of talking tom. $999, way tooo much for such a phone;;;negative;;
Why apple always late. Same old stuff with huge anouncement.;;negative;;;
Surely I will be going to buy this one. Price doesn't matter as easily available 12 months interest free installments here in Dubai on major credit cards.;positive;;;;
This just looks super ugly.;;;;;negative
why is everyone not happy with this phone? I love it!;positive;;;;
Sure, this phone isn't anything hugely special, but it's still a huge step in the right direction for Apple, which has been stagnant for years now.;positive;;;;
The processor is a gamble. On paper, it looks to be a huge leap on existing tech. But you're correct that it's had limited testing, can't wait to see the heat generation.;;positive;;;
A lot of people live the design. Personally, on the internet I think it looks nice enough, though if place it behind both the galaxy phones and the mi mix. In real life I might like it more, I didn't like how tall and thin the s8 was. Plenty of people will consider this the most beautiful phone - especially those with Samsung hate.;;;;;positive
Overall, I think the phone is nothing exciting, but it does compete with the best phones out there. Apples planned augmented reality future seems a bad choice to me, buy here's hoping they do something good with it. Hard to imagine anything not gimmicky, the tech has been around for ages without being useful. Hololens seems the way to go get;positive;negative;;;
Man design is ugly. Phone looks like someone bite top of the screen like is apple on back. To me it seems a worm slowly eating apple and soon or later this company will be sold or bancrupt. Its just asking too much,;;;;;negative
They had a retina display which is good;;;;;positive
cant wait to buy it;positive;;;;
The Iphone X will be a complete waste of money;negative;;;;
Nice;positive;;;;
Well I am an Apple lover . so many mouths and so many opinions . For me there is no one on earth who can challenge apple security system. APPLE is the best . Apple X is the best so far. waiting and dying to buy one for me.;positive;;;;
Thanks Apple;positive;;;;
wonderfull;positive;;;;
8 plus has best cam in the market, this sounds very good for iPhone X!;;;;positive;
The best smartphone camera we’ve ever tested;;;;positive;
Easily the ugliest phone ever made.;;;;;positive
Regarding the screen, i believe it is the first of its kind in which the screen reaches all 4 corners evenly (even though it has a cutout up top) That is innovation in itself.;;;;;positive
top of the screen is totally ugly;;;;;negative
cool!;positive;;;;
I've actually done research on the back camera sensor size on the iPhone 10... and believe it is going to be a 1/2 inch camera sensor size... which is bigger than Samsung camera sensors and will put it ahead of Samsung cameras;;;;;
These phones are so expensive....you can hardly eat when you finish purchase it.;;;negative;;
Undoubtedly iPhone X is a revolution in Apple history.It has to be added that Apple had no alternatives but joining a group of hi ends with new norms and criteria in smartdevice history;positive;;;;
what i concern is not its camera, i know the camera is good overall;;;;positive;
With Super AMOLED display, I think the battery life could last little longer compared to LCD displays. And with powerful A11 chip, multitasking could be more smoother.;;positive;;;positive
The A11 chip is super fast, even par with latest MacBook pro performance. this phone will be fresh for next 5 years (I derived this from my iPhone 5S bought 4 years back but still working great specifically super fast with latest iOS 11);;positive;;;
Iphone x is awful phone;negative;;;;
battery capacity..uhrmm..no thanks. im not just heavy user, im HARDCORE user.;;negative;;;
A great phone for whom who can afford it. I really don`t recommend just because of the price tag.;positive;;negative;;
iPhone X is a superb piece of tech. Love the product. Bought mine from ajio website. had some cool offers on products;positive;;;;
Screen is amazing. Face detection works almost flawlessly for me. Battery is a non issue. Works all day. Love the new gestures. No home button is perfect. Sound from the Lightning Earbuds is the best from Apple by FAR!!! Anything negative is more than likely bashing IMHO.;;positive;;;positive
Its contains lots of awesome features especially Face ID... It’s just too cool.. I used to face finger print detection problem while driving car.... typing password while driving is just too risky.. which now don’t bother me anymore;;positive;;;
My only complaint is the price, Samsung and iPhone are amazing phones. one is good for this, the other one is good for that. stop the hate. but I do have to say that Apple is marking the price way to high.;;;negative;;
love this phone. Swipe up Home gesture is awesome.;;positive;;;
Very nice phone from Apple;positive;;;;
Apple Created the best display I ever seen in mobile phones .;;;;;positive
Best screen i ever seen in any device. It's so perfect that it doesn't even feel like a screen. It looks so natural and real.;;;;;positive
Battery life not great, as expected from iPhone,;;negative;;;
it has a better Camera from another phone in this world now.;;;;positive;
Battery is not as good;;negative;;;
best phone I've ever used. swipe up for home button and face id works flawless even in the dark. phone is a must buy for iphone users.;positive;;;;
Hi Guys, Just to let you'll know that i have bought the iPhone X and its just amazing;positive;;;;
FaceID works like a charm. I dont miss the home button much. I kind of like the notch as it divides the battery from the others notification to the left.;;positive;;;
I have the X and I'm not impressed.;negative;;;;
In January, my iPhone X is going on eBay for sale. It's boring, the phone is several years behind its competitors technology. It's a phone for young people who don't know what the competition has. Yawn.;negative;;;;
Really fast and fluid phone, which is to be expected at this price range, but still, the notch is in some people's opinion ugly. But people can always find something wrong with any product.;positive;;positive;;negative
Battery life with this is very good;;positive;;;
it does have that notch,.it's not ideal.;;;;;negative
Yeah,.there is no doubt the IPhone X is not the best IPhone to as regards to its capabilities ;positive;;;;
Great phone and Face Id works well....!!;positive;positive;;;
Apple x not as well as we thought. Home button is the breath of apple apple 8 is good but older design is not acceptable. Basically apple 8 should have apple x design. Then it would be surely popular at every where. iOS 11 firmware should be improve with give option for direct call in third party dialer. It's very annoying ask confirmation call. Sometimes it's not good. Hope apple will update it sure.;;;;;
Camera is almost real professional!!!;;;;positive;
Faceid is fast and the screen... omg the screen!!!!! Perfect!;;;;;positive
Best smartphone i ever had.;positive;;;;
nice phone;positive;;;;
"I like apple but what preventing me from spending so much money for this phone is the ""battery"". What would you do with a nice phone that would just last for half a day. I'm a heavy user";;negative;;;
Apple always put a iPhone with almost same features as all smartphone have but overpriced its phone ....we can also get Ai . Face recognition in other phones in about 15000 then why waste on iPhone;;;negative;;
Iphone X, failed design, overpriced, not so bezel-less, so sorry Apple, this time is the Era of Android phones.;;;;negative;negative
"it's way too pricely for the ""old technology"" in it";;negative;negative;;
the amoled is gorgeous, the camera is great, you dont even notice the notch (and it is small) so stop complaining people, apple have made a really nice gorgeous phone.;;;;positive;positive
i bought my iPhone X on 4th of November and after using it for nearly 6 days, i came to this conclusion that this iPhone is not worth device by Apple;negative;;;;
feeling bad to say the notch make it even worse than original iPhone.;;;;;negative
Glad to hear in new feature of iPhone X specially in benchmark. ;;positive;;;
I admit I was a bit worried about losing Touch ID but amazingly FaceID seems to work at least as well as TouchID;;positive;;;
Speed is well ... wow ... just like the iPad Pro 10.5. Cameras ... amazing for such a small device;;positive;;positive;
I think the problem of iphone is the battery life if they can make it like 3600 Mah or 4000 it will be great;;negative;;;
The notch itself is stylish and looks cool. Apple tried to make something completely bezel-less;;;;;positive
this is the first phone ever made that i must say-its perfect! Best phone of all times! Only next Iphone x can or could be better-no one else!;positive;;;;
my new iPhone x just arrived,, smooth ,, fast and lovely,, no lag what so ever,, can use it with one hand;positive;;;;
Hardware is unbelievable. Now if only they can improve iOS 11, it would truly be the greatest device ever.;;positive;;;
I've had it since Saturday and I have to say, this is the perfect smartphone on every single level.;positive;;;;
Everything seems perfect with the iPhone X except the notch at top of the screen. If Apple can remove the notch, i will score them 100%.;positive;;;;negative
I just received mine today! I love it NO regrets....no wonder why T3 magazine rated this the premium of premium of phones!;positive;;;;
Best Display. Fastest Processor. Fastest storage. Best update support. Best customer service. Best phone in the world.;positive;positive;;;positive
The iPhone X is superior in many ways do a deep comparison;positive;;;;
The A11 is a six-core, remember that adding dual-core to iPhone is not like adding dual-core laptops and requires a very accurate processor design. The dual-core processor features Performance and high-performance quad-core processors to greatly increase the speed and performance of this mobile device. Conclusion This powerful processor, high performance, and the ability of this smartphone to use various applications.;;positive;;;
It's a stunning device in so many ways.;positive;;;;
using Face ID, it feels like future in your hand. And shows how far these smartphones have gone.;;positive;;;
When you hold iPhone X in your hand with that beautiful almost edge to edge screen;;;;;positive
Man I agree its expensive,It has the best design ;;;negative;;positive
Getting those issues is around same than winning lottery. Haven't had Any issues and the performance is perfect and with 120hz touch input this thing is supersmooth.;;positive;;;
I lost my hope with apple every year i am waiting for something new , but the phone doesn't change same thing with old features andriod has ahead months and years before.;;negative;;;
Iphone x is just a piece of junk;negative;;;;
iphones are better than any other phone especially Samsung, the end;positive;;;;
Apple always slow to get the technology and is always late.;;negative;;;
My iPhone X battery is not work good as other phones while running 4g net I think upgrade for long battery life;;negative;;;
I love this phone;positive;;;;
Everything which is expensive, definitely has nuisance value, do be it!;positive;;;;
We somehow defend iPhone X only by good, better, best having no lingual expression of overall performance, but lip service.;positive;;;;
"I know the phone are not just specs in a paper. But they are performances an measures inside that are reflected in those ""papers"". So stop saying stupid things and get over it,";;positive;;;
I am very disappointed with apple this year, I bought an iphone x 256 gb on the 16th of this month and the Face ID cannot register my face or any other face and the selfie portrait mode is also not working. I contacted apple support team but they canÂ’ Fix it even though they run a diagnostic on my phone. The apple told me that nothing is wrong with the hardware.;negative;negative;;;
What a phone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! hoping to have this one day.;positive;;;;
So much for iPhone X being the King of Speed.;;positive;;;
I used it, great phone but needs more features! Not worth the money imho!;positive;negative;negative;;
Just take a look at the back of the iPad mini and them look at the iPhone x front . Design will be clearly understandable .x is very beautiful but it's not worth the price .;;;negative;;positive
Best phone so far! Been using it since it first cane out here in new zealand! And dont get me wrong i have been iphone user since iphone4 started. So yes its iphone all the way;positive;;;;
I have become a fan from iPhone 6S Plus onwards and on 14th got the iPhone X. In one word, its an experience. The mother of all phones, really. Its insanely fast and smooth. Multitasking and flips over tasks or apps very good. ;positive;;;;
Battery is absolutely insane, so far.;;positive;;;
battery is good;;positive;;;
best camera;;;;positive;
screen is the best;;positive;;;
speaker is so good;;positive;;;
face id works so good;;positive;;;
the notch sometimes makes me feel bad;;;;;negative
Greetings from very happy iPhone X user, not single time i thought the price after i got one, best phone by far i ever had, this phone screams perfection.;positive;;positive;;
Apple is just an overpriced tech with no real Upgrades;negative;;negative;;
Phone is good but not worth at this price;positive;;negative;;
iPhone is just an overpriced no Innovation phone.;;negative;;;
For the same price as Iphone X and fast charging block. plus wireless charging doc and wireless headphones.;;positive;;;
i just love iphone x. I think, it is the best phone in this modern world;positive;;;;
To costly! D:;;;negative;;
Wow such an amazing phone, Apple is such a great company, they are making great devices,;positive;;;;
Very very expensive.....;;;negative;;
Too expensive for that money, you must have very unhappy person to buy this phone to compensate your happiness. It may be good, but for wannabe-s.;;;negative;;
The Apple phones are getting worse and dearer oh my android phones have all this and much more as I've realised recently;negative;;;;
Same Staff Every Year. Apple Is Boring;negative;;;;
Poor Battery;;negative;;;
Too Expensive;;;negative;;
Apple you disappointed US!!!!;negative;;;;
Finally 4g Ram;;positive;;;
The important differences between XS and X is number of sim card. Lol;;positive;;;
why apple iphone battery so poor......... samsung galaxy s8, s9 series better at its price point, quality;;negative;;;
why so costly.....nothing special in iphones;negative;;negative;;
iphone price is acceptable, but iphone very shameful and also no special feature.......and heavy bulky weight;negative;;positive;;
Yes, as the flagship phone, iphone speaker is not that good;;negative;;;
"It is a great camera. So what do you want? New cameras just fo teh sake of ""new""?";;;;positive;
Thousands employees working full year and using multi-million dollars to come conclusions, no design changes. Money wasting company.;;;;;negative
Front camera used 7 mp f2.2?Come on Apple, atleast using 12 mp f1.5 to 1.8!!!;;;;negative;
$1000... has a shitty 4gb of ram;;negative;negative;;
battery size too low how.;;negative;;;
There's only 2 things I like most about Iphone.. 1st is the IOS.. I have no doubt about it.. 2nd is the Video.. the image stabilizer.. Other than that,just the same;;positive;;positive;
APPLE IPHONE IS JUST TOOOOOO COSTY...;;;negative;;
Beauty of iphone is it's os..iOS. ios is optimized heavily for it's hardware. When an App goes to background, ios compresses app (say it occupies 300MB in foreground) by so much and it can compress even to 10MB, if it is required;;positive;;;
Iphone is way overpriced compared to huawei/nokia/others...;;;negative;;
You are right. Apple is beast. I have tried android phones (flagship ones) but iphones still so so strong in everything.;positive;;;;
very poor battery backup;;negative;;;
very small battery in contrast with its display . it needs twice battery charge in a day in normal use.;;negative;;;positive
apple is good in everything except battery endurance;positive;negative;;;
"what is iphone???
MONEY SUCKER";;;negative;;
Same ugly phone, higher price...;;;negative;;negative
Screen is great, very bright and sharp. Video playback is near perfect. Body size is just right. ;;;;;positive
The phone comes a very cohesive package in terms of hardware and software, design and function. Not perfect but no phone is.;;positive;;;
Overall, the XS won't disappoint but it's not cheap.;positive;;negative;;
Haven't tested out the camera much but a couple shots turned out nice.;;;;positive;
i don't know why They always give poor battery capacity which don't go more than 90+ endurance.;;negative;;;
Sorry iPhone your notch is just annoying. Can you just make your phone without a notch?;;;;;negative
The iPhone XS has a markedly improved dual camera, delivering better photos ;;;;positive;
Best Phone i have ever used;;;;positive;
IPhone xs very very very...... Poor battery.;;negative;;;
The beauty of iPhone's battery life. Its steady, its reliable, no matter what you load on it. No matter the condition. Connect to Carplay Wireless, add a Apple Watch, and you still have almost the same battery life you take out of the box.;;positive;;;
I am here to say why iPhones still superior to any Androids phones and worth its cost.;positive;;positive;;
It is a very crisp looking screen display.;;;;;positive
I am on the 12.1 IOS update on 10/30/2018. So far I am delighted with my phone. Lots of settings and easy to navigate. The display is sharp and true in color.;;positive;;;
I wish it had Dolby Atmos for music and other multimedia. The audio on the supplied ear pods is excellent. The speakerphone and ringers (and alerts) are louder than my previous phones.;;positive;;;
I would recommend the Xs to my friends;positive;;;;
arguably the best phone on the market, but god that price....;positive;;negative;;
It Is An iPhooone,With A Nice Camerrra!!!.;;;;positive;
This phone has best camera in this price segment;;;;positive;
Battery backup is very disappointing for this display size ,with moderate use i have to charge it in the evening;;negative;;;
The camera is the best in the market, there is no denying. Everybody on YouTube can tell you the truth. SmartHDR truly is a breakthrough in smartphone photography.;;;;positive;
this are better cameras according to popular opinion;;;;positive;
Camera is very good, compared to 6S. I did not have any chance to compare this against any other phones except my old LG G4 and HTC One M7.;;;;positive;
Looks premium and beautiful.;;;;;positive
Screen is Brilliant. (With True Tone On and with True Tone Off);;;;;positive
Battery as per my usage - Photos, Whatsapp, Viber, Phone Call, Youtube and some other stuff last for 1.5 to 2.5 days depending on the day to day usage. But I am very happy with it.;;positive;;;
Notch - may be it is obtrusive for some, but it is not obstructing me. Got used to it.;;;;;positive
very pricey;;;negative;;
phone nowadays is getting slow when it comes to innovations. Globally speaking, top smartphones are samsung and huawei. It shows to the market that iphone is not the usual iphone anymore.;;;;;
same price as motorcycle...pffttttt..;;;negative;;
nice phone but I just cant come to spend $1625AUD on this phone...;positive;;negative;;
IPhone XS is the best phone in the world. Use the phone first then we'll talk or you can go to istore & play around the phone;positive;;;;
If you have the money get it, best phone on the market, don't believe...me get it play with it then come back and comment.;positive;;;;
Perfect for grip and superb performance and looks apple did an amazing job again;;positive;;;
its battery life is terribly dissapointing.;;negative;;;
iPhone Xs is complete crap.;negative;;;;
This is the first iPhone ive ever bought, performance is great and UI is nice and fluid.;;positive;;;
This phone is just not worth the price;;;negative;;
The Battery is better than the previous model I have used for a year (iPhone 7 ) I only charge it while I am sleeping using the wireless charger.;;positive;;;
The phone is really fast comparing with other old models.;positive;;;;
The camera is fantastic and the beauty mode in selfie is not weird as I found on Samsung or Huawei.;;;;positive;
The camera is very disappointing in the dark. The pictures turn out very blurry. It also seems a strange filter is placed on all my photos.;;;;negative;
Awesome camera and functionalities. Cheers to Apple for their amazing innovation;;positive;;positive;
This is the best ever phone I've had so far.;positive;;;;
right now iOS does not have a system wide dark theme. but it is rumored that apple will implement dark theme in next release of ios 13 this year.;;positive;;;
The best phone on the world!;positive;;;;
iPhones are only good for their design that's it;;;;;positive
Apple is ahead of every Android smartphone with a two years ahead unbeatable chipset ( A12 bionic) better and faster updates, better software optimizations and better quality with stereo speakers, amazing display and high quality materials ;;positive;;;positive
"what this ""bezelless"" bulshet all the time, look at that thick bezels around the display and 83% display ratio";;;;;negative
This evaluation aims to examine how the iPhone XS is believed to be the best iPhone so far. ;positive;;;;
The iPhone XS is the worst of the new iPhones;negative;;;;
Oh my!!!!, im really shocked.. what happen to apple designer? Did you see all 2019 smartphones?. Really really ugly 2017 design. What a horrible notch;;;;;negative
Worst design by apple;;;;;negative
This seems to be the ugliest Apple product for decades.;;;;;negative
Designers could have spent some more time for back camera pattern or design;;;;;negative
very old and outdated design;;;;;negative
apple has set the notch trend back in 2017 but it looks like the 2019 notch design a bit outdated;;;;;negative
It has a 720 p display with a powerful processor;;positive;;;positive
I thought the screen resolution would improve to full HD. Still a ripped off with that high price;;;negative;;negative
this phone is a joke LCD screen no fullhd resolution 4GB ram;;negative;;;negative
Seriously, I can't see any feature that will trick or make people to buy or upgrade to this.;;negative;;;
the camera looks ugly;;;;;negative
Better CPU, more RAM, more battery and another camera;;positive;;positive;
No fhd screen,no audio Jack, very small battery, terrible wake up Apple.;;negative;;;
Low resolution display, huge cutout, mediocre camera, no telephoto camera, no 802.11ax WiFi, no 3,5 mm jack, no USB type C port, no NFC etc etc;;negative;;negative;negative
iPhones can still hold their price;;;positive;;
so no 5G? will prefer to stay on older device...;;negative;;;
No fingerprint;;negative;;;
bad display (LCD), low resolution;;;;;negative
no 3,5mm jack and ancient USB 2.0.;;negative;;;
What they should've done was use a bigger battery. This phone is massive yet they decided to put a miniscule battery in it;;negative;;;
The resolution is fine.;;;;;positive
you know the specs are trash. Apple is brand quality and brand quality only;;negative;;;
Still the fucking notch.;;;;;negative
Get real Apple, tis is very bad;negative;;;;
Still sticking to a crappy age old screen resolution. What an upgrade Apple!;;;;;negative
still no full HD display in 2019 lmao how are they getting away with that without getting shit on by everyone;;;;;negative
Omg even xiaomi mi 9t is better then this;;;;;
Design is too worst;;;;;negative
The specs are quite literally the best on the market;;positive;;;
The GPU was already insanely better than any other GPU on the market and they improved it even more. Apples chips are 2 generations ahead of other chips, look up benchmarks.;;positive;;;
It also has the same cameras as the 11 apart from the tele, which will probably be the best camera on the market.;;;;positive;
Insane price for only $700. This model will be a top seller no doubt.;;;positive;;
It's a shame that we have to bought phone with LCD display in 2019;;;;;negative
Yeah. It's still a trash spec;;negative;;;
Still no 5G.... Wow Apple you can only do this;;negative;;;
Faster more energy efficient processor;;positive;;;
Bigger battery. Faster charging. Battery would last 4-5 hours more now;;positive;;;
Finally, an ultrawide camera. Better camera. Better video. Better selfie camera;;;;positive;
Design is very poor;;;;;negative
Again and agian 720p screen;;;;;negative
apple seems lost its steam;negative;;;;
cheep look in back side;;;;;negative
The main problems are that iPhone 11 screen is not OLED and you cannot watch 1080p YouTube videos on it;;;;;negative
At least Apple is smart enough to increase battery size on the 11;;positive;;;
a bit smaller notch. a little bit.;;;;;positive
2 big issues when price is that high, LCD screen and not Full HD display. Its freaking 2019/2020. Is it too much to ask from Apple.;;;negative;;negative
its 699 us dollars so idk what your talking about;;;positive;;
Iphone 11 should normally come with a FullView screen display instead of an oudated notch. and battery capacity should be at least 4000 mAh.;;negative;;;negative
There is no doubt app system and overall user experience in better on apple;;positive;;;
Well, dual camera, improved IP68, and the A13 are simply awesome;;;;positive;
Another dealbreaker is the screen resolution, you can't even do social media at full quality,;;;;;negative
Seriously? 350ppi display for that price?;;;negative;;negative
The screen resolution is low for the price;;;negative;;negative
Camera design is less terrible than other two models, It still got a notch there. Wobbles on table :/;;;;;negative
Great specs, except of it's golden price;;positive;positive;;
This would have been a really good phone if it were OLED screen;;;;;negative
if you look at the camera it looks terrible;;;;negative;
iPhone 11 has 4GB RAM;;positive;;;
Apple should make some phone in low budgets.cause iPhone 6 is not available much.We need a budget phone.;;;;;
i feel better user experience in the IOS than android;;positive;;;
Camera quality is good and does a really good job ;;;;positive;
iPhones are not expensive;;;negative;;
battery is a joke.;;negative;;;
i''m an Apple user myself and I must said that it has been a great experience overall;positive;;;;
Samsung is really good at photography and note 10 plus is similar price;;;;positive;
iphone with ios is always good for long term;;positive;;;
Why these horrid notches;;;;;negative
I liked the camera;;;;positive;
Iphone 11 pro and max are too expensive for me.;;;negative;;
Camera is great. All round great phone.;positive;;;positive;
The price is so so so high;;;negative;;
Upgrade iphone 11 this morning. Very happy with it;positive;;;;
iOS is simply magical.;;positive;;;
This phone only has a 828x1792 resolution LCD display;;;;;negative
Better battery, camera ( 1 extra ultra wide) and processor.;;positive;;positive;
these are not so bad just overpriced;positive;;negative;;
it works nice, price is fine as you are high income, done deal.;positive;;positive;;
it get hot when using and the battery life is not that good.;;negative;;;
the battery life, while not the top of its class, is enough to get you through the day, especially as of late;;positive;;;
Iphone has high end specs;;positive;;;
it has very nice display;;;;;positive
phone already last damn long;;positive;;;
These back cameras looks so ugly;;;;;negative
overall just a better phone.;positive;;;;
better screen, about the same performance, bigger screen. better cameras;;positive;;positive;positive
an overall better camera system;;;;positive;
The battery life is good for a phone with 3000+ mAh capacity, ;;positive;;;
The performance is really good;;positive;;;
the camera is another story, the image quality looks so bad on the ultra-wide angle shot, it is like oil painting when zoom in to see the details;;;;negative;
screen resolution is definitely a factor but overall i am satisfied;;;;;positive
i was impressed with performance and battery life;;positive;;;
camera is average;;;;positive;
display is good.;;;;;positive
not oled screen;;;;;negative
THE BEST device I have ever owned.;positive;;;;
The display is bright, vivid and colors are great;;;;;positive
The camera on this thing is amazing as well.;;;;positive;
The battery life is better;;positive;;;
The speakers are better too, loud, clear and rich;;positive;;;
would highly recommend it to all people looking for a flagship that would not break their bank;;;;positive;
I am extremely happy with this device;positive;;;;
You're getting probably the best battery life in probably any smartphone right now.;;positive;;;
The iPhone 11 has the fastest performance in the world;;positive;;;
great battery life;;positive;;;
amazing cameras;;;;positive;
The only dated parts of the phone are the display and the notch, neither of which are awful.;;;;;negative
The faster processor, better cameras, better battery life, extra gigabyte of RAM, and other things make this a good buy.;;positive;;positive;
You'll also be giving up the telephoto camera for an ultra-wide angle camera;;;;positive;
good battery life, good camera and regular updates.;;positive;;positive;
720P screen is outdated;;;;;negative
Almost 200g why so heavy;;negative;;;
I don,t like the look of the Phone. It should have had an Attractive look.;;;;;negative
Camera to me have reached a stage so good;;;;positive;
software is not so efficient;;negative;;;
So nicely built hardware;;positive;;;
iphone is smoother;positive;;;;
iPhone 11 has better camera sensors which captures more details;;;;positive;
iPhone X wins is with the display and the 3D touch.;;positive;;;positive
iPhone 11 is a no worries phone;positive;;;;
It got flagship specs, top camera, apple care support, best app selection, good for 5 years or more, no worries on apps;;positive;;positive;
This phone is alright and not too expensive;positive;;positive;;
the design is boring;;;;;negative
the chipset is very fast and the OS is bloat-free and efficient.;;positive;;;
Truthfully, the picture quality is good;;;;positive;
the user interface because for me its really great so far;;positive;;;
i have no problem with the camera;;;;positive;
iPhone 11. What a disappointment;negative;;;;
Really disappointed in Apple this was not ready for market;negative;;;;
I love iPhone 11.;positive;;;;
Camera is Bomb. I havent seen good camera like this;;;;positive;
Battery lasts much longer than 7 Plus;;positive;;;
Overall good Apple product with normal price;positive;;positive;;
Face ID is very secure, it won't unlock when your eyes are closed;;positive;;;
I agree iPhone 11 is powerful, good camera, no lag;positive;;;positive;
iPhone11 is efficient, it can even navigate and charge fully using a car 5watt charger.;positive;;;;
Great phone, never regret buying;positive;;;;
Everything look sharp and high contrast, even when it is LCD screen.;;;;;positive
It's battery life is super long, only 3101mah as stated in this website last 24hrs usage.;;positive;;;
Unlocking is soo much better then my old phone, fast and easy.;;positive;;;
it is rather hot when playing games;;negative;;;
I have used one week the results are satisfying;positive;;;;
Biggest bezels on the latest phones can be found on iphones;;;;;negative
Its hardware and software works seemlessly together to provide the premium feel.;;positive;;;
It contains only 3110mAH battery, and yet that battery capacity rivals phones with much much bigger batteries.;;negative;;;
Its LCD screen is on par with top of the line android flagships, without light bleeding.;;;;;positive
I currently use iphone 11 and im unimpressed with its display;;;;;negative
the 720 display is one of the biggest flaw the phone has;;;;;negative
Iphone 11 is a good phone;positive;;;;
its slow charging is really annoying and it doesnt feel original when holding it.;;negative;;;
I must say I am quite impressed by this phone;positive;;;;
You'll never understand the experience unless you've used an iPhone for considerable amount of time.;positive;;;;
I am happy enjoying iPhone's experience ;positive;;;;
Should have put an oled in this phone;;;;;negative
display is very poor;;;;;negative
this is the most powerful smartphone on the market right now and it performs like a pro;positive;;;;
great speakers with Dolby Atmos and spatial audio, great battery life, performance ;;positive;;;
Everything in this phone screams high quality;positive;;;;
LCD display is not good for this price;;;negative;;negative
Love this device;positive;;;;
Battery for all day long, the best camera, ultra smooth and the screen is very very good!;;positive;;positive;positive
LOL, the big-ass notch is still there;;;;;negative
Face ID or not, that is one ugly notch.;;;;;negative
this is it! one of the best mobile in industry!;positive;;;;
I dont like this design;;;;;negative
this is the design? sad...;;;;;negative
looks ugly camera bump;;;;;negative
12 MP camera sensor again, with 2x optical zoom again... Wow!;;;;positive;
Very bad design and specification;;negative;;;negative
This phone is intriguing, I'm thinking about upgrading my phone so I'm looking forward to hearing reviews!;positive;;;;
It is still one of the best camera for smart phones if not the best. Reviews can attest to that.;;;;positive;
This phone is extremely overprized;;;negative;;
I am talking about apple and it is overpriced. With no advanced features;;negative;negative;;
poor batery;;negative;;;
Great Phone. They have done it again. Time for the upgrade.;positive;;;;
Steve jobs must be shaking his head in the grave after launch of iPhone 11 pro. They are totally outdated in terms of design and features now;;negative;;;negative
"188 grams for a 5.8""? LOL, this is ridiculously heavy; I don't want to feel like I'm carrying a brick in my pocket!";;negative;;;
Finally some good f*cking battery life;;positive;;;
Its not a 120hz display its a 60hz display with 120hz of touch-sensing;;;;;positive
"It's just an iPhone XS with third camera and ""better"" display.";;;;positive;positive
Overpriced phone;;;negative;;
this is an absolutely overpriced shit.... even after this huge price tag what you'll get is 18w fast charging when rest of the world is using 25w or higher, 2x optical zoom when other companies have reached 5x,10x,....seriously apple...are you kidding?;;;negative;;
5G not Supported , it's Huge Limitation.;;negative;;;
still 3 year old display with huge notch ugly camera setup & with huge prices.;;;negative;;negative
Totally disappointed. Ugly phone of the year.;;;;;negative
3190 battery life is very disappointing at the price point.;;negative;negative;;
Dissapointed, im buying P30 PRO. This phone is ugly.;negative;;;;negative
Thats huge notch. while other brands try reduce notch size;;;;;negative
Welcome to apple. We at apple would like to introduce the iphone 11 and for the first time in apple history we are giving you a fast charger in the box!;;negative;;;
Very soon you will see other android devices copying this ugly design.;;;;;negative
Camera looks like philips electric shaver;;;;;negative
Love it;positive;;;;
Very poor back side design from apple(stive jobs);;;;;negative
for the iOS,no one would think Apple is actually selling a good products to consumers.;;positive;;;
So Ugly on it camera.nothing special compare to Xs..dunno what Tim Cook and the team is doing...nothing special except for the camera part...no longer the leader in Tech Industry... announcement damn boring...the whole world could see the actual design even before apple announced it yesterday...are they own the patents or somebody else?;;;;;negative
Yes, you are right. I'm not the buyer and I don't care about this phone. Just here to see the alien design camera. I'm from India, and It's priced at Rs 99990 ($ 1395) for the 64GB variant. Just too much inflation.;;;negative;;negative
quick charging is still slow and the battery life subpar;;negative;;;
At least it finally has a triple camera setup, but the notch is still horrendous. If this was their low end offering i'd consider this against something like mi 9 or mi 9t pro, but at a thousand bucks this is a hard pass - can do so much better for that kind of money.;;;;positive;negative
t's a good change so far. Great to know that it has an ultrawide lens. selfie video with slow motion, selfie 4k video wide lens, and ultrawide. So much packed for the same price as last year.;;;;positive;
Cameras at the back look so bad!;;;;;negative
the design innovation and features RIP apple.;;negative;;;negative
Samsung s10e is 400$ cheaper and 38 gr lighter with the same size;;;positive;;
Yeah, the iPhone 11 keeps the notch. l hates the iPhone notch.;;;;;negative
hey need reduce the notch. Too big for 2019 phone;;;;;negative
i dont like back design;;;;;negative
I never liked iPhone before but now this is the best iphone ever (for me);positive;;;;
notch is neutral for me, good specs and camera;;positive;;positive;positive
All useless features.;;negative;;;
And still take better photos and videos than other android phones around.;;;;positive;
Dude, 5G isn't perfected yet. Apple is really smart for not including 5G on iPhone 11 series.;;negative;;;
For Apple who has had some of the best designs ever.;;;;;positive
Camera design is bad.;;;;negative;
have a better option for the front cameras.;;;;positive;
Just wish they got rid of the notch.;;;;;negative
it has nfc?;;;;;
this new 11 series looks awful because of ugly back design and three cameras. Why too many cameras there is no need for three or two cameras one is enough.;;;;negative;negative
The X design is awesome;;;;;positive
I own an iPhone X right now, working excellent bought last August 2018 and battery life is 96%.;;positive;;;
the design is terrible come on apple you can do better than this or do you want to fall out of the tree;;;;;negative
Apple must be kidding me;negative;;;;
The design is from 2017, this is already the third generation with the same design. Just like Porsche 911 designers, iPhone designers also don’t have much to do. Look at the iPhone 6, 6s, 6s Plus, 7, 7 Plus, 8. All the same design. It is not ugly, but a bit boring. When I hold my iPhone 6, it still looks good, but it is just boring to have the same design for generation after generation. And it has these huge bezels all around since the iPhone X.;;;;;negative
You don't change the design in the sake of changing.;;;;;negative
Every year, the phones apple launch, influences the phones coming out later in the year or the year after. Many Chinese brands that have much potential become misguided by apple's old outdated design which holds the industry back. If their phones don't sell enough, other companies will be discouraged from copying it which will spark more innovation. So yes, the amount of sales they get does affect us.;;;;;negative
At the current state of the industry, Apple is feeling the market pressure from the Chinese brands. If they continued the 2-year-old design any further, the sales of iPhones would take a huge hit. Although the final product has turned out to be garbage, cooties to them for at least trying.;;;;;negative
Still no USB-C, design is disaster, price is high.;;negative;negative;;negative
Camera has improved but it also did on Android, so we have to see how well it'll go against the competition.;;;;positive;
All in all, I'll never pay over 500 or 550€ tops for a phone.;;;negative;;
The camera is always 12mp with iphone. camera is bad;;;;negative;
Camera on my DSLR is 12MP and it takes great photos. more mexapixels doesn't make your photo look better, it can actually be opposite if the sensor and lens aren't very good. That's why there's no MP war in mobile world, because companies knows adding more mexapixels doesn't make your photos better.;;;;positive;
confirmed only 4g ram;;negative;;;
2019 One Of The Worst Design In Apple..Really Disappointe.. Hate This;;;;;negative
4 GB RAM in 2019, for 1000$ phone, is insane even iOS is optimized, 3rd party apps are becoming more hungry.;;positive;;;
Don't buy;;;negative;;
iPhone 11 PRO and iPhone 11 PRO MAX have 4GB RAM only;;negative;;;
The picture looks good in samsung because they have much better screen resolution and pixels per inch(ppi). Thats the only reason. You can compare;;;;positive;
It remind of cheap brands phone having 3 or 4 camera if this is the real pictures iphone shares must be falling rapidly;negative;;;;
It is the fastest smartphone ever. Think about reality insted of spec sheets.;positive;;;;
the real compact phone!!;positive;;;;
But the design is horrible. I was waiting for iPhone 11 to show up. I just didn't believe the design pictures in the leaks, it turned out to be true. Really disappointed in Apple to come with such an ugly design in 2019.;;;;;negative
I like the iOS.;;positive;;;
Guys ! We can't ignore the excellence of iPhones. In each and every manner there is no substitute of apple. The display quality, the operating systems nailed it's reflection on other os. The sound and the feel of iPhone has no replacement in this world. In simple words can't wait anymore for new I phone .;positive;positive;;;positive
That's a bit exaggerated, The redesign is terrible this year, battery is sub par by today's standards and only perk of getting new iPhone is A13 chip.;;positive;;;negative
Design is definetely better then brick. Innovation a lot better as it gives a feel of Philips Norelco Electric Shaver. Personally i would rate this phone very highly since it has 4k video recording front-back and still has 64gb option.;;positive;;positive;positive
Apple at its finest.;positive;;;;
It is absolutely beast(processing power) then its predecessors iphones.;;positive;;;
All in all a great product.;positive;;;;
An absolute recommend.;positive;;;;
Finally in terms of pricing, it's reasonable since its an iphone and provides value to its users by its name itself.;;;positive;;
I've grew up on windows machines. Made the switch to mac so for music production and as such have been immersed in the apple ecosystem. My last phone was the iphone xs 64gb. I decided to buy the s10+ on a whim and have been thoroughly impressed with the samsung. I am honestly not impressed with the iphone 11. Sure iOS offers a slick user experience but its not enough to justify apple ignoring the clear advantage the current android flagship phones have in terms of specs. Thumbs halfway down for me.;;negative;;;
Get a used iPhone Xs or Xs Max, much better.;positive;;;;
closed apple ecosystem is like living in north korea, no freedom;;negative;;;
Very EXPENSIVE for almost Nothing! Apple is SIMPLY playing MIND GAME with Apple Fans. I think is not a Good Practice to Stay Ahead a Brand Ambassador;;;negative;;
That's a very good decision and of course the XS has a much beautiful design!;positive;;;;positive
Imagine not buying one but wishing you could and instead hanging around on the iPhone 11 pro comment section of gsmarena to troll because you really want one.;;;;;
The Only Advantage in iPhone 11pro is some special camera features and not to forget 800 Nits which is Pretty Awesome for HDR;;;;positive;
"there is no need for bezels design wise. All of the future phones should be bezel-less. iphone 11 design looks ancient, outdated, useless, terrible, disgusting to me. If it was notch-less with full screen on the front, and have a good back design; I would pay a few hundreds more for iphone 11 pro max.";;;;;negative
Dont know how is Iphone 11 outdated, you probably never tried it in real life;negative;;;;
Got the phone today and the design looks very good in real life and the new cameras are stunning.;;;;positive;positive
 Overall this is definitely a good upgrade over the x but I would not like to say it would be a huge leap over the xs.;positive;;;;
It does have faster face I'd than my iPhone x but I cannot find any difference in the screens at all. Battery life is not what I thought it would be. There is no way that my iPhone 11 pro would last 4 hours longer than my iPhone x.;;positive;;;
Excellent phone good camera. Night mode is good but could be better. ;;;;positive;
new cameras, but can't do 8K30 video;;;;negative;
Camera in daylight is amazing and the skin tone is the best I've seen. Impressed with the cameras.;;;;positive;
Dont expect 4 hours more screen-on time, noone said you would get that, 4 hours more is a best case scenario with varied usage. Build realistic expectations through understanding what youre reading.;;positive;;;
I don't like it;negative;;;;
Nothing new here moving on.;negative;;;;
Yea I mean it's a new iphone with the same specs as the 10 and yet the Samsung galaxy S10+ has way better specs;;negative;;;
"Got my 11 Pro 512gb today, coming from Xs. Worthy upgrade? Yes absolutely, though i have to admit that wideangle photo is as i expected; not very useful but it could be handy at times. Performance is ofcours extreme, faceid is noticeable faster than Xs, the texture of the back glass is awesome.";positive;positive;;positive;positive
First of all, the fact that it's only 12 megapixels means absolutely nothing, the image quality is still amazing. Second, if you're complaining about RAM on an iOS device, you've clearly never used one in your life.;;positive;;positive;
The display super retina and cpu hexagon is extremely satisfy but still poor battery;;negative;;;positive
the iphone is best phone in the world but thats what apple fans think.;positive;;;;
iPhones are way better than android except the price that too in India.;positive;;negative;;
Radiation level is beyond threshold in the new iPhone 11 (Pro too), even without any data connection. Also, support forums at apple site have gone nuts over heating issues, draining batteries, blurry wide-angle camera, etc. Even a premium brand is still far from perfection.;;;;;
Camera is not extraordinary, does not let you use night mode on wide angle camera.... huawei let's you.;;;;negative;
Battery compared with huawei is a joke.... Always looking for percentage and for charging places.;;negative;;;
I have been used for half a month and overall it is ok;positive;;;;
I cant believe how horrible sound via headphones is.. i used android for few years and am totally surprised how bad sound is. Iphone 3gs had much better sound quality via 3.5mm jack. Am just sorry for people who listen this garbage everyday. Peace;;negative;;;
This is the world most, superb , extreme, ultimate device;positive;;;;
Now it is perfect design of Apple.;;;;;positive
I love it so much;positive;;;;
Worst design ever saw in a phone;;;;;negative
What a big notch;;;;;negative
Nice phone, but this little beast will cost at least $1400 where I live haha man those prices.;positive;;negative;;
This is the second ugliest phone;;;;;negative
IPhone is making the ugliest smartphone;;;;;negative
Don't think this will bring anything revolutionary to the table;negative;;;;
Truth that you leave... It's the ugliest iPhone ever!;;;;;negative
Very bad rear design;;;;;negative
Cool for some people, but ugly for most;;;;;negative
this phone will be utterly disappointing.;negative;;;;
the huge notch in 2019 is unacceptable;;;;;negative
Amazing device;positive;;;;negative
Personally I think that this is the ugliest design of iPhone;;;;;negative
Nice Speaker array on the back;;positive;;;
Apple's worst design;;;;;negative
12 MP camera sensor again, with 2x optical zoom again;;;;negative;
Still 3500 battery;;negative;;;
Ugly design;;;;;negative
So, still NOT QHD screen, still NOT more than 12 Mpx Camera. No 3,5 mm Jack, Still no Card slot.;;negative;;negative;negative
Absolutely overpriced;;;negative;;
Still the notch.;;;;;negative
Another overrated and overpriced worthless phone haha;negative;;negative;;
What I hate about this phone is that NOTCH and that FREAKING HUGE HOLES CAMERA!!;;;;;negative
Look here. Hole punch is still a notch;;;;;negative
Same ugly design every year.;;;;;negative
way over priced - - as always;;;negative;;
Not Happy about that phone really;negative;;;;
It has almost nothing new and uglier design.;negative;;;;negative
Why do they keep this old notch and screens;;;;;negative
the battery capacity is still small comparing to other Android phones;;negative;;;
the design of camera is ugly;;;;;negative
it's soo expensive,at this prices you can buy a better phone;;;negative;;
Ugliest design ever;;;;;negative
ugly designed camera;;;;;negative
The best design ever, WO;;;;;positive
Older design and not yet 5G support ;;negative;;;negative
Lol 6gb ram;;negative;;;
The design is horrible;;;;;negative
The ugliest notch in 2019.;;;;;negative
The A13 chip is the power, which will skyrocket compared to any other device on the market today;;positive;;;
I really don't like that big notch. looks outdated already.;;;;;negative
I Love This Product;positive;;;;
This is Most Powerful and Liked Phone from Me;positive;;;;
really disappointed;negative;;;;
The phone is quite good.;positive;;;;
There are no 5G network;;negative;;;
poor upgrade from last year;negative;;;;
the worst looking screen/phone ever;;;;;negative
omg so Apple really released this shit looking phone to its customers.;;;;;negative
Worst backside design in a phone and still the big notch while some other phones have removed the notch completely.;;;;;negative
The most ugliest phone ever made;;;;;negative
better camera and speed;;positive;;positive;
A13 is more powerful processor than any other phone;;positive;;;
Nothing new here, same design, difference! is the back that is ugly AF sorry am not a hater I just gotta be honest looking;negative;;;;negative
Too much Weight;;negative;;;
226 g, that is far too heavy!;;negative;;;
Oh my god. No in display fingerprint.. cost 11 hundreds of dollars..;;negative;negative;;
Looks like an Alien;;;;;negative
226 grs? You're joking.;;negative;;;
no change at all disappointed;negative;;;;
Camera look like ugly but that will be another trend like notch.;;;;;negative
Iphones are more and more putting on weight. Too heavy phones is a nightmare for the hands.;;negative;;;
where is the 5G band its time to make 5G support phone.;;negative;;;
camera still 12MP;;;;negative;
Very very Bad Design This;;;;;negative
ah...battery!;;negative;;;
It looks like Philip's shaving machines;;;;;negative
No 5G network support in Iphone yet.;;negative;;;
226g weight like a metal bricks??? the weight is about almost the mate 20X weight! Shame apple!!!;;negative;;;
Alien like camera lens phone??? I hate this phone design.;;;;;negative
most ugly phone on world;;;;;negative
same specificaticons as previous model, no micro sd , no 3,5 mm audio jack, no 5g;;negative;;;
overpriced;;;negative;;
Wtf .. battery;;negative;;;
worst looking phones ever;;;;;negative
Nothing new, nothing impressive. No innovation at all;negative;;;;
Just Love the Apple iPhones;positive;;;;
very bad and old look back cover style come on iPhone what happened with your designer team its look like a normal phones;;;;;negative
The only thing i dont like about this phone is the design. cameras looks weird;;;;;negative
Wow, an iphone with OLED display. Took them a while.;;;;;positive
Old phone in old design;;;;;negative
this is the ugliest phone ever.;;;;;negative
this is the best in smartphone industry;positive;;;;
it looks a great phone;positive;;;;
one of the best ever;positive;;;;
Disappointed with the design...I thought the could pull a big surprise as they did with the iPhone x but no;;;;;negative
Too big and akward notch ... backside cameras looks like tripple barrel gun;;;;;negative
I will never change my android for an iPhone they don't have no difference from the android the system that iPhone are using android did have it first very disappointed;negative;;;;
ugly iphone.. same design with useless notch;;;;;negative
the NOTCH just got wider!!!!;;;;;negative
They have upped their game a little bit but kept the same design to be honest I would go for the huawei flagships and Samsung flagships instead.;positive;;;;negative
"The ""worst"" iPhone design ever. Camera placement looks like a fidget spinner and notch is very annoying. 0/10 for the design.";;;;;negative
not gonna lie apple is going to face problems;negative;;;;
But lame design. And it gonna feel heavy on the hands;;negative;;;negative
It's dope;positive;;;;
This design shows that Apple is totally out of ideas;;;;;negative
Although the camera setup is not the most appealing one, it's still a beautiful and extremely capable phone.;;;;;positive
O boy ugliest iphone Ever. looks like spider eyes;;;;;negative
Apple you should learn from MEIZU how to make beautiful phone with thin bezel instead of ugly notch...;;;;;negative
What a terrible design;;;;;negative
Fastest CPU and GPU, others still struggling to catch up with previous gen CPU.;;positive;;;
At the core of this update is Apple's new processor, the A13 Bionic, which Apple claims is the fastest CPU and GPU in a smartphone.;;positive;;;
Big Disappointment.;negative;;;;
Spider's eyes low spec. Worst update.;negative;;;;
4GB RAM is a disappointment. it should have been 6GB;;negative;;;
This camera looks like fidget finger. Nothing new;;;;;negative
The most advanced ugliest camera ever on a phone;;;;;negative
Why is too expensive ?!;;;negative;;
the phone is damn so beautiful especially cams form and replacement;;;;;positive
Same front design (notch);;;;;negative
Same 4 GB RAM;;negative;;;
Same 64 GB ROM to choose minimum and above (price tag);;negative;;;
No 5G;;negative;;;
No reverse wireless charging;;negative;;;
Additional 3rd Camera Lens (Ultra Wide);;;;positive;
Slight improved CPU;;positive;;;
Slight improved GPU;;positive;;;
Apple has hurt its fans by introducing ugly looking back of new 11 series.;;;;;negative
The reason why Apple is still overpriced is because of that NOTCH!!!!!;;;negative;;negative
I'm sorry, but the iPhone notch is HIDEOUS.;;;;;negative
The first time I saw the iPhone X, I couldn't believe they would release something so damn ugly. Now it is 2 generations later and that damn notch is still ever present.;;;;;negative
worst phone ever lol;negative;;;;
No USB C type port;;negative;;;
yes the best phone hands down just because they say it must be true;positive;;;;
Hello, i agree with you, the notch looks a little dumb.;;;;;negative
The ugliest 3-camera phone placement I've ever seen.;;;;;negative
They have introduced new feature called Heptic touch;;positive;;;
Apple don't know the meaning of the word Innovation;negative;;;;
New pro max is hefty quarter a kg weight and thicker;;negative;;;
Bezel are even thicker and notch;;;;;negative
I’m an Apple user and I’ll even say that this release is truly disappointing;negative;;;;
There is very little difference between the 2018 and 2019 devices, both aesthetically and technically.;negative;;;;
Horrible. Enough reason to pass along with the price.;negative;;;;
Ok, i know that the optimisation is good and so is the ecosystem so, yeah fine, use iPhones.;;positive;;;
I'm a fan of apple but the fact is we have been seeing same prior notch design for 3years Apple please bring some innovative design at least for new year incremental approach needs to be change now...we all want revolutionary steps from apple in next year..;;negative;;;negative
For the people who use it for the ecosystem and fluidity, I just don't think it's worth it just for that considering the price you're paying for it;;;negative;;
APPLE SELLS OLD TECHNOLOGIES AT LAST SEC INOVATION PRICES to loosers that now nothing outside Apple environment;;negative;negative;;
The iPhone 11 pro Max already has a bigger battery compares to iPhone XS Max!;;positive;;;
why aren't they going for a different thing...because iphone 11 is same as the iphone 10...only the camera structure is differs from the other one...so hoping a bigger difference in the future,,;;;;;
But, iPhone 11 has ultra-wide camera too;;;;positive;
Sorry, but it's ugly;;;;;negative
Wtf 4gb ram in 2019???? .....(No comment);;negative;;;
Don't mind them.iOS is ahead of Android like 10x far better. Android users including me should just accept it. Let everyone stay on their lane;;positive;;;
This is real badass phone.;positive;;;;
Best camera and video camera;;;;positive;
Best screen;;;;;positive
Best CPU;;positive;;;
Best GPU;;positive;;;
Best performance;;positive;;;
Best battery life;;positive;;;
Best price.;;;positive;;
Only 4Gb ram???;;negative;;;
Best phone ever..;positive;;;;
Boring phone with big price, making the same thing every year;negative;;;;
Apple invented notch but don't know how to remove the notch;;;;;negative
You are totally right, iPhone is the worst;negative;;;;
Still ugly still notch still stupid design and still 99.9% customer satisfaction;;;;;negative
it has 3696 battery capacity nice;;positive;;;
I'm not gonna bad-mouth the iphone11, it really looks good (at least not as ugly as most early leaks and rumours had suggested);;;;;positive
The thing is Apple is more optimized. While more RAM, CPU speed, etc. will definitely help;;positive;;;
It's the best phone ever.;positive;;;;
Battery charging is so late;;negative;;;
from my point of view Apple lost its edge this year with iphone 11 and 11pro;negative;;;;
just got this phone! And the camera is crazy good;;;;positive;
4gb of ram at that price!??? I can find a phone with 8gb at over half the price or I can build a gaming pc with 4x times amount of the ram. So over priced;;;negative;;
It has the best battery life for a 2019 flagship;;positive;;;
Best screen;;;;;positive
Best CPU and GPU;;positive;;;
Best battery life;;positive;;;
Best still and video camera.;;;;positive;
This phone is really killing it;positive;;;;
I've never been an Apple fan, but this phone is exceptional in so many ways;positive;;;;
its display is among the best in the market in 2019 and so are its cameras and build quality;;;;;positive
Its CPU, GPU and battery performance is the absolute best in any 2019 phone so far;;positive;;;
The large notch will always remain the same eyesore as in the times of the iPhone X, and the camera arrangement on the back is definitely not the best looking.;;;;;negative
over priced;;;negative;;
Iphone 11 pro max now this time stil best phone of the world;positive;;;;
Much better if iphone have radio and dual sim;;positive;;;
so expensive;;;negative;;
I got gifted the iphone 11 pro, it costed way too much i can agree on that;;;negative;;
It has great colour calibration,bright display,good viewing angle,great black deep for lcd screen plus it has 120hz touch-sensing which i can feel the silky smooth experience in scrolling and tapping;;;;;positive
I have a space gray and it looks very good in real life.;;;;;positive
If we talk about the rear it's probably the ugliest iPhone ever, they could make a better job with the cameras area.;;;;;negative
Faster in opening phone menus even when windows are closed (finally !) Some apps open much faster and pages within those apps load much faster , but only some apps. Regardless, this is probably attributed to iOS 13;;positive;;;
Goddamn this phone is ugly. So what is making people buy this phone with the same design.;;;;;negative
Hate that notch. No innovation coming from Apple in design;;;;;negative
Absolutely right.... Apple phone its really a horrible product;negative;;;;
Fastest smartphone on the planet, plain and simple..;positive;;;;
I cant believe people still pay Apple's extortionate prices for sub-standard tech;;;negative;;
Bad design;;;;;negative
The best phone currently you can get is the Iphone 11 pro max, the display is really gorgeous and the processor A13 will remain the fastest, the battery is really good for me as very heavy user;positive;positive;;;
seeing only 8 mpix selfie camera is not really good.;;;;negative;
Camera only 12 MP and Battery only 3.500 mAH ? No !;;negative;;negative;
If only there was a 1TB storage and 12GB RAM variant of the smaller phone.;;;;;
Why FM radio in USA & Canada only?;;;;;
They giving the lower end phones bigger battery;;negative;;;
Samsung should build a larger battery like other mobiles.. that's critical for flagships..;;negative;;;
The S10 have a 3500 mAh battery!;;positive;;;
Samsung always lies on official renders of phones, they always show less bezel then are the case.. Samsung are liars;negative;;;;negative
3300 mah battery are you made Samsung??;;negative;;;
Weak battery;;negative;;;
Bad battery and front camera looks annoying. Disappointed;;negative;;;negative
The only weak point is the battery, otherwise this phone is solid;positive;negative;;;
the weak battery is a deal breaker for me.;;negative;;;
Samsung offers luxury and comfort while Apple offers well-maintained secrecy;positive;;;;
every phone which comes battery under 4000mah won't stand a chance in the competition who offers big battery. I can see people who buy below 4000mah phones will complain endurance, hardly a day or less than 10hours.;;positive;;;
It's got a big hole in the screen. No thank you.;;;;;negative
I prefer to see better resolution;;;;;negative
The battery capacity will upset most of us. We expect 4000 mah+;;negative;;;
not worth it;;;negative;;
Battery capacity is a gimmick;;negative;;;
Why NO Radio FM available for Europe ?! Is a true non sense;;negative;;;
Batery only 3300 why ????;;negative;;;
You can stick a s7 edge battery in a s6 which has a 3500 mah battery and the standard s6 battery is 2550;;;;;
Samsung need 24 MP;;;;negative;
S10 just bring few features.;;negative;;;
When is the official launch date in India, any idea ?;;;;;
Maybe the battery is not accurate. It must be more than 4000mah.;;;;;
US Version 6GB Standard? Worth it to upgrade from S8+, I slept on the S9+ because it was too different externally, just internally.;;;;;
900 euros is very high price though.;;;negative;;
a great device with the Triple rear cameras, the headphone jack, Micro SD card slot and all the usual Samsung's goodies.;positive;positive;;positive;
Sadly we will have to get used to the ugly holes just like the notches;;;;;negative
Yet again dissapointed to see smaller battery;;battery;;;
With the Snapdragon 855 efficiency and reduced power consumption the 3400 MaH battery will be fine;;positive;;;
battery is enough... you need one day full usage.... the next half day is useless...;;positive;;;
camera in display, ugly design, worst than Notch...;;;;;negative
man these specifications are not so impressive should've made that battery 4k with the latest rivals giving more lifespan and that megapixels is not high;;negative;;;
love all the specs but fck with that price tag, it should cost 650$, 700$ top;;positive;negative;;
Yeah.. no 6GB RAM version of S10 :) only S10e has 6GB RAM;;negative;;;
I'm glad Samsung didn't take away the 3.5mm headphone jack and micro sd card slot. Way to go Samsung! I will stick with you.;;positive;;;
good bye samsung;negative;;;;
FM radio just for USA and Canada, really? I will look for a phone which bears in mind the rest of the world.;;negative;;;
the notch is ugly as hell.;;;;;negative
The camera should have gone behind the screen.;;;;negative;
Disappointed phone.;negative;;;;
the worst thing is samsung included a bunch of wallpapers with dark corners to hide the notch. the battery capacity is also less;;negative;;;negative
Respect for Samsung didn't take away like others the 3.5mm jack and micro sd slot, but the price is to high now.;;positive;negative;;
Missing IR Blaster, that's important for me;;negative;;;
No micro SD card slot in S10!!! Only in S10+(up to 512GB) today spoke with samsung representative.;;negative;;;
This phone is a joke!;negative;;;;
"why everyone is so harsh with this new samsung and give very very bad comments. i reviewed the iphone section and i can't see any badwords there.is it because its ""apple"" so it cant be compare buy any brands? if its not on your expectation at least u can give a civilised opinion. Be a human, not a savage apes. and one thing if you cant buy it, just shut your filthy mouth and fingers off";;;;;
while you guys complain and say sh*t stuff about this, samsung is making huge money from these phones;;;;;
Looks like garbage.. No thank you;;;;;negative
what a great phone. it full me with joy;positive;;;;
It looks preety cool.;;;;;positive
I love this phone !;positive;;;;
And again we have no specification on the SD card type compatibility;;negative;;;
So far this beauty is first in the list for the my next phone. It checks all the boxes I need and the size is perfect;;;;;positive
Exynos 9820 sucks... Europeans are getting ripped off by Samsung;;negative;;;
brilliant job by SAMSUNG. S10 is LOOKS promising;positive;;;;
very very costly cell phones, I am using S7 edge since last 4 years i am quite satisfied with it and do not need to change with new one. it is all vastage of mony.;;;positive;;
S10 family welcomes you.i am very happy & fully satisfied in the phone feature.;positive;positive;;;
Speaker on the right bottom and the selfie camera on the top right.... U will cry and so disturbing when u gaming and video.. what a shame and failed design big brand Samsung! This is a simple knowledge how u don't know that! OMG!;;negative;;;
Front camera location - bad. Top and right part of the screen from front camera seems to be useless! Only to drain battery! am I right? And no big improvements over S9 camera. Only wide angle and zoom lens were added. What about sensor? is it the same as on S9?;;;;;negative
Bottom Bezel more bigger than top;;;;;negative
Wait this has FM radio cool!;;positive;;;
and the good part is that it has a headphone jack !!! totally worth the price;;positive;positive;;
Tried the S10, not impressed. Seems a lot like my S9, but it is even taller.;negative;;;;
The chrome body around the phone looks old fashion. Can't see any reason to upgrade. But speaker still really good and loud.;;positive;;;negative
Why are you exiting about this phone ? No much improvement (exept for the price);negative;;negative;;
Wish the s10e too had the curved edge display like its big bro;;;;;negative
Come on now. Either all countries should have the sd855 or all should have the exynos one. This is discrimination. Samsung should know better.;;negative;;;
Samsung will always be king phones;positive;;;;
Rumors say they will keep the notch one more year :/;;;;;negative
Galaxy s10 is perfect size for me, but I'm worried about the battery;;negative;;;positive
the price is way too expensive;;;positive;;
Why they give only 15w charger in s9 model they gave 18w charger;;negative;;;
S10+ ACCETABLE battery life, S10 poor poor battery life. I wanted S10, now I think weather to accept a bigger phone or a weaker battery;;negative;;;
The front camera looks quite small and nice in preview;;;;;negative
Charging speed is fantastic dont see the numbers , i charge it from 25 to 100 in 50 min.;;positive;;;
Size, is perfect !!! And it is realy fantastic;;;;;positive
Battery: after the 3rd cycle is good. Now i am talikng to you and my SOT is 1 hrs and 3 min ... The battery now is 91% ... I think is is learning my use.;;positive;;;
Front camera, has group selfie and that mean wide camera so u have wide angle selfie dont worry... And i dont mean panorama i mean realy wide angle;;;;positive;
Speaker are damn good;;positive;;;
The finger print needs to be press a little harder i have no idea why maybe because of the screen protector ( it comes with pre installed screen protector );;negative;;;
Speakers are very load !!;;positive;;;
guys its so disappointed to see all reviews focusing on the s10+ only and no one mention the perfect size s10 , i myself was looking for battery test as this is my main concern with the normal s10 , but end up hopeless and order it myself , hope the battery is onbar/near the s10+;;negative;;;positive
the battery life is one day no more with normal use;;positive;;;
The worst battery life of the Galaxy S10 range. Average usage should get you through the day but heavy usage your probably gonna need a charge by teatime. Dread to think how long it lasts if you use the reverse charging and have the always on display on.;;negative;;;
FM radio (USA & Canada only) = I am from Europe, then I don't buy this phone.;negative;negative;;;
I almost ordered this one. I switched to S10+ for the poor S10 battery. Lower even than S8. They should have put at least 3700MAh in S10. I was so angry with Samsung that I almost give up on S10 for this reason. There are a lot of people that give up for good. Samsung lost some clients for this.;;negative;;;
Also back video does not support ultra wide recording, only to take photos. I would not say its a big improvement over s9;;;;negative;
s10 has great features and I do not regret swapping from iPhone to s10;positive;positive;;;
I got my s10 bout three days ago and I love it heaps it is a very great phone;positive;;;;
Super phone in all sense. ;positive;;;;
Battery backup satisfactory. Camera very useful type. Good buy.;;positive;;positive;
Battery life is quite poor.;;negative;;;
I have the phone got it yesterday the battery is ok. All depends on your usage/setttings;;positive;;;
I received my s10 two days back..except battery life, everything is excellent. Getting only 18 hours...even In idle condition battery draining drastically;positive;negative;;;
The display is beautiful and I don't notice the cutout anymore, especially with the R2D2 wallpaper.;;;;;positive
This phone is fantastic. Fast, easy to hold and just everything a premium phone should be. I have had if two days and so far no issues with battery.;positive;positive;;;
Earlier people complain about notch. Now with Galaxy S10 series owners playing with new wallpapers.;;;;;negative
iPhones are just way better. No matter how many upgrades the galaxy models have, the software can ever compare to IOS in any iOS device;positive;positive;;;
I am using s10 now from 8 days.. All is well but battery life is very less. Maximum 16 to 18 hours even on power saving mode is on. Especially battery drain fast during idle mode. Samsung should fix that issue by update.;;negative;;;
Thank you Samsung for keeping the headphone jack.;;positive;;;
No matter how good is your phone, without a good battery life, it's frustatting !;;negative;;;
Samsung battery sucks i got a J200f but i hate its battery improve on that.;;negative;;;
Best phone i have ever used - excels at everything. Except battery. I'm getting fed up with Samsung not sorting this. I know the S10 Plus has decent battery, but their smaller models always suffer. I've optimised the phone, taken off all advanced features i don't use, removed bixby screen, even went as far as to using HD+ only and the dark theme (which i actually enjoy), yet it doesn't last throughout the whole day.;positive;negative;;;
I just bought S10 a few days ago. No doubt it's a great phone but I have started to face some issues which are quite irritating.;positive;;;;
Secondly, the notification light. The notification light is a concern for me as I used to judge my notifications with the color of notification light. Now it's not there anymore.;;negative;;;
The last one is the front camera live focus. If you select other options like zoom and the one ones, they lag a lotttttt.;;;;negative;
Have dual sim card model.;;;;;
Fast phone.;positive;;;;
Good display.;;;;;positive
Good camera (like the wide, normal, and zoom mode).;;;;positive;
Battery.. yes it is a bit drain faster(approximately after lunch time battery level would hit 20% or something. Would be goof with 5.000 mah, bht i dont thnik size would be the same.;;negative;;;
Anyway fast charging feature work well, only need 1 hour to fully recharge (use qc 2.0).;;positive;;;
You are right about the display. It's not as vibrant. I've tried to change all settings and it's still dull and washed out looking. Hope they fix this.;;;;;negative
the wide angle camera and the battery life is better than the s9 plus. I'm happy with my decision;;positive;;positive;
This phone is great.;positive;;;;
i wanted to purchase this device as i love the look, display & camera;;;;positive;positive
Just looked at specs of this phone 16MP camera... Really??? same as the......S6!!!;;;;negative;
finger print scanner not workin after using a glass screen protecter;;negative;;;
Im disappointed with battery life, i can get 4h/5h screen time.;;negative;;;
The main camera has 12MP! It's the ultra wide cam that has 16MP... You can see it in the specs. Its extremely great camera;;;;positive;
It seems that 3,400 mAh battery is not good enough to sustain the specs of S10;;negative;;;
low light photography is not that good.;;;;negative;
The image quality is not that impressive in low light... Video is very hazy in low light,Will it get any software updates? I am using it for 3 days;;;;negative;
Get the S10. I've used it enough to say it's one of the best phones out there. Cheers!;positive;;;;
Battery goes down 8% in a hour when also i not use this phone.;;negative;;;
Excellent device except battery. Battery draining is very fast and over heating when using internet.;positive;negative;;;
Best smartphone on the market!;positive;;;;
"Samsung Galaxy S10 launched without light LED notification. Without such feature, flagship may be called ""Samsung ship without Flag"". Hurry up Samsung before getting too late to loose your fans.";;negative;;;
That is why I need bezel where all sensors, including notif.light, are in.;;;;;
Other than that, the punch hole does not really bother me (better than stupid notch design) and great job on battery life as well.;;positive;;;positive
Updated from S9. As a vloger, I especially love the camera and video. Stabilization quality and the color is just so much better.;;;;positive;
I am really enjoying my galaxy s10. Thanks Samsung for an Awesome phone!;positive;;;;
SAMSUNG S10 also has a lot of problems especially the software.;;negative;;;
the led is around the front camera, you just need to activate it.;;;;positive;
Samsung's flagship series lovers are crying like wounded lion just to tell u why you abandon Light notification in S10 variants. Please pay attention and include it in next update;;negative;;;
In my country S10+ price is about 1050 EUR which matches here. But S10 price is 954 EUR which does not match here.;;;negative;;
I am dissapointed with this 6.1' small screen and this punch hole. I was expecting hole-free screen.;;;;;negative
Samsung Is Undoubtedly High Functioning Affordable Phone Than Any Smart Phone.;;positive;positive;;
i am facing battery drainage problem. phone getting hot frequently. battery drainage exp id i charge to 100 then if i start to use in 10 minutes it sropa to 97..then drains 1 percent evey 2 to 3 mins.;;negative;;;
Mediocre battery life especially for a flagship;;negative;;;
fingerprint sensor doesn’t always recognize my thumb;;negative;;;
This phone is a total crap unless you want use to take nice pictures;negative;;;positive;
Selfie camera is worst, no clear image, battery drains fast can last for 6 hours and how can i share my power to others if it's insufficient for me;;negative;;negative;
This is an amazing cellphone.;positive;;;;
The camera is amazing as always. I love doing photography and get a lot of compliments on the pictures. ;;;;positive;
My only issue with this phone is battery life. ;;negative;;;
No Notification Light in the S series ... whaaaat ! no led light in a 900 euros phone, so pricey;;negative;negative;;
After 5 weeks, i can easily say this is the best phone i've ever used.;positive;;;;
But there's still one issue with the S-series phone from Samsung, especially the smaller ones: BATTERY!;;negative;;;
Notificacion light is a must-have , another one that lost it, in a 1000 euro price range is way too much.;;negative;negative;;
the display is fantastic and the performance is so good.;;positive;;;positive
For me, battery life is great - easily better than my old S8. Most nights I have around 50% battery remaining and around 3 hours of SOT;;positive;;;
The build quality is excellent.;positive;;;;
This device's build quality is excellent.;positive;;;;
Camera punch hole actually doesn't bother you after a day of usage.;;;;;positive
Battery life is phenomenal. I easily get around 5 1/2 to 6 hours of screen on time;;positive;;;
Best things of this phone is the display quality. Samsung has definitely kept its best display for its flagship devices. All in all I am really happy and satisfied with this device.;;;;;positive
Its a fail! What poor battery it has.;;negative;;;
Best phone I've used. Fingerprint issue? No just ad same finger 3 times or something then it works alot better. Not the fastest but I use face unlock so never bothered by that.;positive;positive;;;
Speakers are amazing, so is the screen and the cameras.;;positive;;positive;positive
Just a tat smaller would have been better (S10e feels too cheap for the price). Too bad fingerprint reader is slow, but i don't use it anyway.;;negative;positive;;
Just bought the phone. Coming from S8, i am impressed. Perfect for me, and storage 128 GB is great.;positive;positive;;;
Fingerprint reader performance was not so good;;negative;;;
samsung Exynos processor is not good.;;negative;;;
bad battery;;negative;;;
Battery life is very less.;;negative;;;
The face unlock works instantaneously;;positive;;;
Speaker louder with more bass.;;positive;;;
Screen is really better than S8, brighter. Screen is less curved than on S8, i like the small curve actually;;;;;positive
bad battery;;negative;;;
Finger print scanner is fast after update, face unlock instantaneous, speaker super loud, great camera at night, battery ok .;;positive;;positive;
Really good phone, no problem.;positive;;;;
Phone has really loud speakers;;positive;;;
SAMSUNG phones camera app got a Pro mode. You can adjust the ISO manually like the Pro photographer.;;;;positive;
S10 is way ahead regarding cameras, memory, screen, speakers...about everything.;;positive;;positive;
the camera and the fingerprint scanner have been improved.;;positive;;positive;
only stupid thing is with this phone its way to pricey with no fast charging as you after spend nearly £60 for you to have the fast charging to work;;;negative;;
Everything Looks Bad Except To Be Honest The Benchmark Is On Top Of All Device!;negative;positive;;;
I love iphone;positive;;;;
Very low screen resolution;;;;;negative
Damn, I thought about buying this phone in the near future, but that low resolution is a big NO NO for me. Plus, that $750 starting price tag is also a big NOPE!;;;negative;;negative
no 3d touch ? LOL!;;negative;;;
iPhone XR has lower resolution, but has the same A12 chip , that means it will perform better in games !;;positive;;;negative
Who will buy this piece of waste with such low resolution;positive;;;;negative
This shouldn’t have been priced more than 500$. Come on Apple, at least release a budget phone, below 400$.;;;negative;;
Well this phone is pretty legit to me, so I'm ok with its price.;positive;;positive;;
Good for you. I like that they went for 120Hz for the displays, camera looks to be on the Pixel level, or even above, finally some decent Screen to Body ratio for mainstream phones.;;;;positive;positive
There is nothing wrong with the specs of this phone.;;positive;;;
they have to get out of their way to put a low resolution display in this one. that's quite sad due to the A12 SoC which is overkill for the resolution;;negative;;;negative
Very best phone with best size;positive;;;;positive
Time to go to APPLE iOS!;;positive;;;
I love the price and specs;;positive;positive;;
It's stupid for Apple for putting a 720p display ON A $750 PHONE! Ya'll always find a way to defend Apple. ;;;negative;;negative
Same here bro, i also like iphone xr look better;positive;;;;
In my opinion it's absolutely crap phone. Huge (even wider than Galaxy Note), heavyweight with low resolution screen, and as usual for Apple - no 3.5 mm jac;;;;;negative
Well A12 bionic chipset is absolute beast. That saying, I'll see next year's iPhone launch and if I won't be blown off by anything there or if they won't launch any smaller phone;;positive;;;
I Like this phone;positive;;;;
2018 n apple trying to sell a hd+ display for 750+ !! crazy;;;;;negative
iPhone 8 plus is much better in almost every aspect compare to this with same price;positive;;;;
it looks great. Will have to wait for some real reviews until jumping to conclusions.;positive;;;;
The price (€850) and the low resolution for this screen size (DPI is actually OK) are the most concerning issues with this phone.;;;negative;;negative
every thing ok. but only the thing design, its looks same , only the different the camera structure, hopeless!;;;;;negative
"WTF!!!!!??? 800p screen in 2018? And on the 6.1"" screen? Also IPS for $900?? That's really crazy";;;;;negative
It's incredible how people are so stupid to buy an iPhone when is over priced and worst then Android;negative;;negative;;
Worst product from Apple.;negative;;;;
Totally waste product an 700 dollar phone they can't even give an 1080p screen.;;;negative;;negative
Apple can't even provide an 1080p screen for this much huge upfront and simply names there worst product with there stupid name.!!!;negative;;;;negative
Totally a waste product;negative;;;;
Screen to body ratio sucks, its bezzels are super thick on sides.;;;;;negative
costs abt $700 and dosen't have full HD display eeewwwwwwwww..;;;negative;;negative
what a pathetic device...;negative;;;;
Apple's been there, done that and moved on. Get with it.;positive;;;;
can't play 1080p content because of its resolution, shame;;;;;negative
Everything looks cool but the price and size of the phone's HUGE!!!;positive;;negative;;
this phone is not fast charging, takes 5-6 hrs with original charger and 3-4 hr with other fast charger. ;;negative;;;
not a good phone.;negative;;;;
battery better than xs and any iphone ever;;positive;;;
I just bought tge iPhone XR it’s actually amazing ..;positive;;;;
iphone xr display is very poor 326 ppi, not recommended. image not clear.;;;;;negative
the one-day battery life is amazing.;;positive;;;
I used to be skeptical about the resolution being 720p but once i bought and use it, you can't even tell the difference.;;;;;negative
The thing costs $1150 and only has a 720p+ screen haha this is so overpriced;;;negative;;negative
Just upgraded from 7 to XR and it's a really great phone. XR is a good upgrade for you.;positive;;;;
Moreover, the battery life is extremely good. Gives you a full day from average to moderate use. The only downside is it's bulkiness. Rest, it's a good package.;;positive;;;
Go for iPhone XR. It's a great phone. My dad is using it for the past one year and he hasn't faced any problems till date.;positive;;;;
better camera and specs etc,except the bezels but its not that big of a difference, better battery life;;positive;;positive;negative
It works great and from the processor to the camera i had nothing to say. Honestly I recommend this phone it’s absolutely fabulous. Thanks;;positive;;positive;
Who will pay $850 for outdated LCD Panel display;;;negative;;negative
Apple is garbage as it is. Will never spend money on any apple product as it is way overpriced.;negative;;negative;;
This is awful. Looks like a kids phone;negative;;;;
People call it budget with price of 850 eur ..oh wow;;;negative;;
I wonder who will spend all that money on the model that makes them look like they're too poor to afford the real thing;;;;;
720 p display what the fun . iphone is cheating people;;;;;negative
terrible notch design;;;;;negative
Apple provides great after sales warranty support, regular software and security updates.;;positive;;;
The phone you buy will be supported for a long time.;positive;;;;
Iphone xr is the best low range phone;positive;;;;
720p display on a 6.1 inch screen. With such a tiny pixel density is a laugh;;;;;negative
$750 is the new standard of Apple calling it budget. But it's still damn expensive;;;negative;;
on top of that the A12, the great camera and you have a clear winner. No wonder it's gonna sell great.;;positive;;positive;
Incredible phone at this price and comes with an amazing screen;;;positive;;positive
Im so confuse with display;;;;;negative
it's not worth buying. The pixel density is lower than average on flagship phones with Amoled displays.;;;negative;;negative
Extremely disappointed with Apple.;negative;;;;
flagship device with a 720p screen at the end of 2018, what a joke;;;;;negative
Looks like apple is now trying to create a trend where thicker bezel is the new cute design....hehehhe;;;;;negative
750 dollar for a 720p phone lol. apple is living on the loyal sheep they harvested for years.;;;negative;;negative
i think this is the cheapest phone of apple and reasonable price compare to other phone.;;;positive;;
to me 720p is good enough;;;;;positive
very good work from apple, there are people who don't care about the display. and to be honest 326ppi in a 6.1 in display is going to be very good.;positive;;;;positive
720p for 2018 phone is ridiculous;;;;;negative
eagerly waiting iphone XR beast!!!! this iphone will crush all mobiles even XS in each and every dept.;positive;;;;
apple is xr best;positive;;;;
The bezels on this phone are too thick.;;;;;negative
Xr LCD, one camera, 64 GB, camera bump, NOTCH for 850 euro. NEVER;;negative;negative;negative;negative
I find the iPhone less and less appealing;negative;;;;
I think the iPhone XR is actually this year's best option for (most) people looking to buy a new iPhone this year.;positive;;;;
The camera on the XR has a larger sensor than the iPhone cameras from last year, but loses the telephoto lens. Still, the larger sensor is a worthwhile trade-off IMO.;;;negative;;
XR is Beast!!!!;positive;;;;
It has telephoto, but the main camera of X is worse.;;;negative;;
Xr Camera is same as Xs main camera, and with Smart HDR, it is actually a huge step forward.;;;;positive;
Ridiculos low resoultion;;;;;negative
I love this iPhone. Cool color especially the coral.;positive;;;;
Much better priced, all I need, bigger screen and better battery life - no choice!. Cant wait;;positive;positive;;
Wise choice! You'd also get a great audio experience;;positive;;;
No headphone jack - no deal.;;negative;;;
No fingerprint sensor;;negative;;;
No super amoled just lcd;;;;;negative
Only hd;;;;;negative
No bluetooth;;negative;;;
No headphone jack;;negative;;;
No sd card slot;;negative;;;
Notch;;;;;negative
ios is worse than android;negative;;;;
Trash I thought that iphones are the best;negative;;;;
Face ID is there as a replacement to Touch ID, it may be slightly slower but it is much easier to use, just look at your phone;;positive;;;
Yes but past 300ppi your eye can’t see the individual pixels unless you use your phone at 2cm from your face like an idiot;;;;;positive
iPhones are good all round phones. If you want a phone that will do what you need, get an iPhone;positive;;;;
Apple ecosystem works really well together, apples w1 chip for headphones is really convenient and the battery life is best out of the new iPhones;;positive;;;
Very Big and heavy. If Apple doesnt bring a smaller, lighter phone in the near future, bye bye iPhone. I want a phone with maximum height of 142 cm and no more than 160 gr.;;negative;;;
Got my iPhone XR today and I'm X happy with the phone;positive;;;;
Everyone knows the specs are good. But the price is not justifiable;;positive;negative;;
At this price I expect a 3500+ mah battery and at least a 1080p screen. It won't kill their profit margins that much... in fact it might increase it;;negative;negative;;negative
No xr is trash;negative;;;;
this phone lacks the basics of smartphone no fingerprint sensor no full hd display and no super amoled no micro sd ;;negative;;;
it's camera isn't that gold many phones have better cameras;;;;negative;
The only good think about this phone is software and chipset;;positive;;;
It has a good LCD screen and a small battery;;negative;;;positive
This phone is very big and heavy. ;;negative;;;
Ugly notch. no fingerprint sensor;;negative;;;negative
worst phone from apple;negative;;;;
This phone is sadly too big for my hands. Will stay with my iPhone 7 until the 8 or X are cheap used.;;negative;;;
Simple, compact and hi Tech;positive;;;;
From the reviews it almost sounded like we would be able to see individual pixels like a supermario game but the display is actually very decent, though the phone is costly overall. ;;;;;positive
it is a 720p display but it is sharp and bright;;;;;positive
This particular LCD is the best on the market in the history of screen making! This is quite attractive to me, I could complain about pixel density as everyone is doing but I believe is much more appealing to have a screen with low PPI rather than having a 4K screen with color shift value of 10, hard to see outdoors etc;;;;;positive
the bezels are so mich thicker than so many other phones.;;;;;negative
I like the design of the X series;;;;;positive
The screen wasn’t as bad as many said. Got my XR a few days ago and it was a fresh design from my previous 7plus . If I want a very good screen viewing;;;;;positive
i have to tell you that screen on this guy is amazing.Color is not yellow like on other two its soo well calibrated and is brightest screen i have seen.Plus side is that feels much more fluent and smoother due to lower resolution,and i really dont notice pixel even though i have sharp eyes;;;;;positive
it’s a solid gaming phone with the best iOS battery life..;;positive;;;
A lot of people said bad things to the display but I've found that xr with 826p(326ppi) looks so vibrant than mine even my phone rn is fhd+.I have tried it at apple shop and the display not the best but still looks excellent for me;;;;;positive
