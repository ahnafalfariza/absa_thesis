17,"In my iPhone 6 when I double tap the home button, it brings the screen down so I can reach the area in the upper part with one hand. I think this feature is missing in iPhone X.

38,I'm not iPhone user or a fan.. iOS is very smooth and doesn't need much ram like android. It is well optimized. But apple could give more but they want to cut the cost everywhere and charge the most to take it the profit in large margin,-,positive,negative,-,-

40,"one word for now, ""ugly""",-,-,-,-,negative

92,"Nothing special about this phone, as always a lot of noise and blaba. Just the name you have to pay for.",negative,-,-,-,-
93,i think its a great new take on the design but i think it would have been better with at least the option of having the matte black or jet black colour,-,-,-,-,positive
94,"I love the design of that thing. Its perfect size, flat screen and rounded stainless steel sides should make for a great in hands feeling and probably user experience. Would be buying one instantly if it was priced competively.",-,-,-,-,positive
95,An over priced junk has arrived again The iphone X . the touch id should have be there . for this price . 1150 bucks .,-,-,negative,-,-
96,Ugly screen compare 2 samsung edge series screen,-,-,-,-,negative
97,no finger id. face id some low light condetion not work perfectly. bad move apple,-,negative,-,-,-
98,iPhone X's gesture controls is the single most underrated feature nobody is talking about except for Michael Fisher aka Mr. Mobile. It's webOS reincarnated. Swipe up to close apps and carousel to the next ones will feel awesome!,-,positive,-,-,-
99,This is INNOVATION! Super AMOLED & Wireless charging! OMG Best PHONE EVER!! I love you apple thank you so much for these breathtaking novelty. I admire such innovative company. God bless you apple. Peace,-,positive,-,-,positive
100,one thing that i realize in iphone is nothing but price,-,-,negative,-,-
101,Love the new iPhone X,positive,-,-,-,-
102,I love the classic iPhone design. More bling-bling under certain lighting conditions. The Apple logo on the back also looks much nicer with the white glass rear. You can barely recognize it on the darker one.,-,-,-,-,positive
103,Very disappointed..,negative,-,-,-,-
104,Great specs!,-,positive,-,-,-
105,I would really love to own one soon.. :-),positive,-,-,-,-

107,It's so girly... but nice design :),-,-,-,-,positive
108,Huge side bezels,-,-,-,-,negative
109,"Too High and costly for its cost over features. Iphone X is not worth that amount, its just costly for the hype of the brand apple iphone thats all.",-,-,negative,-,-
110,The iphone x is gorgeuos,-,-,-,-,positive
111,So... they finally caught up in some 2014 android features and added a bigger screen. Innovation!,-,positive,-,-,-
112,no fingerprint..... hahahahaha,-,negative,-,-,-
113,Its all perfect but the most disgusting part is at the top where the front cams are. Its really annoying especially when it comes to me because i have an OCD (symmetrical) i prefer the infinity display. And I think iPhone X is fragile and definitely i'm gonna freak out if I accidentally drop it. It's Costly right?,-,-,-,-,negative
114,It will fail because they don't have a fingerprint scanner and face unlock is inefficient and garbage.,-,negative,-,-,-
115,Maybe They aren't big innovators anymore But They still make great phones !,positive,-,-,-,-
116,This is the first Apple phone that caught my interest. Now I'll be saving some money for this phone :),positive,-,-,-,-
117,Only Face id just absurd.,-,negative,-,-,-
118,iPhone X is the best phone in the whole universe.,positive,-,-,-,-
119,"it might not that ugly when u see it in front of you..as ppl who saw it in front of them, many of them say it is beautiful",-,-,-,-,positive
120,iPhone x very impressive in design and specifications. But tooo much expensive. the 256Gb one will cost more than C$1700 including tax in Canada. However i felt like there should've been a 128Gb instead of 64Gb.,-,positive,negative,-,positive
121,can't wait for this. omg going to be a long 2 months for me.,positive,-,-,-,-
122,ridiculously over priced!!!,-,-,negative,-,-
123,"i like ios, and apple products, but this one is gross, its ok to pay a big price if its feature pack, but paying a big price just for a bezelless design? its gross, sorry apple, im not a sheep yet, waiting for next year again for some worthy phone to throw a $$$",-,negative,negative,-,-
124,Most advanced and best smartphone ever made. This is the phone of the future. Others are looking like they came out of the stone age compared to this. Face recognition is the first ever and can never be duplicated. Super Retina Display is also the most advanced screen tech ever made. Wireless charging is also the first on a smartphone.,positive,positive,-,-,positive
125,In my country Apple products are really overpriced so this phone will be super Xpensive,-,-,negative,-,-
126,"This phone looks interesting, its specs look very attractive, but it's not a device for small pockets and was never intended to be. I see there it's some kind of fashion to remove the middle button and extend the display. All right and fine, until we look at the display design, it looks like some kind of ass with those top display margins that show the status bar in the middle with the mic and camera.Again, it's expensive for what it brings.I say this especially by the display design and, of course, the 3.5 inch jack, that was never brought back.",-,positive,-,negative,negative
127,Awesome as ever.,positive,-,-,-,-
128,The phone is good. But the pricing is worst...,positive,-,negative,-,-
129,No Finger print sensor. No headphone jack. Eeewww.,-,negative,-,-,-
130,"Well, I think that this phone its really expensive",-,-,negative,-,-
131,Its not best smartphone,negative,-,-,-,-
132,this is worth to buy for me. i have the money to buy every apple product. its not hard to spend my money to buy apple products.,-,-,positive,-,-
133,Im still sceptical about the bezel. Hands on video shown that it is thicker than it seem. Or maybe it just the lighting. Does this really count as bezel less? The chassis is kinda fat too. Hmm. Hope they can improve the design next year. Just a little bit more. Seriously. Just a little tiny bit more improvement it can be perfect.,-,-,-,-,negative
134,I think face id is not a good idea for me. Because some people are very busy not aware of using or trying to look at with your phone while working or doing,-,negative,-,-,-
135,"The best thing I like about this phone is the A11 Bionic Chipset. This is going to be miles ahead of all the other chipsets in the market. Really Apple, has kept itself ahead in the race by making sure that they own every technology that goes into making their phone. ",-,positive,-,-,-
136,My Dream Iphone!,positive,-,-,-,-
137,"My only concern about the phone is that it looks ugly. In fact, all Apple's big phones aren't that good looking, but maybe the background of this phone makes it worse...",-,-,-,-,negative
138,"Ridiculously overpriced and nothing new. except for the new built in apps which android users have been using since years. just a modified version of talking tom. $999, way tooo much for such a phone",-,-,negative,-,-
139,Why apple always late. Same old stuff with huge anouncement.,-,negative,-,-,-
140,Surely I will be going to buy this one. Price doesn't matter as easily available 12 months interest free installments here in Dubai on major credit cards.,positive,-,-,-,-
141,This just looks super ugly.,-,-,-,-,negative
142,why is everyone not happy with this phone? I love it!,positive,-,-,-,-
143,"Sure, this phone isn't anything hugely special, but it's still a huge step in the right direction for Apple, which has been stagnant for years now.",positive,-,-,-,-
144,"The processor is a gamble. On paper, it looks to be a huge leap on existing tech. But you're correct that it's had limited testing, can't wait to see the heat generation.",-,positive,-,-,-
145,"A lot of people live the design. Personally, on the internet I think it looks nice enough, though if place it behind both the galaxy phones and the mi mix. In real life I might like it more, I didn't like how tall and thin the s8 was. Plenty of people will consider this the most beautiful phone - especially those with Samsung hate.",-,-,-,-,positive
146,"Overall, I think the phone is nothing exciting, but it does compete with the best phones out there. Apples planned augmented reality future seems a bad choice to me, buy here's hoping they do something good with it. Hard to imagine anything not gimmicky, the tech has been around for ages without being useful. Hololens seems the way to go get",positive,negative,-,-,-
147,"Man design is ugly. Phone looks like someone bite top of the screen like is apple on back. To me it seems a worm slowly eating apple and soon or later this company will be sold or bancrupt. Its just asking too much,",-,-,-,-,negative
148,They had a retina display which is good,-,-,-,-,positive
149,cant wait to buy it,positive,-,-,-,-
150,The Iphone X will be a complete waste of money,negative,-,-,-,-
151,Nice,positive,-,-,-,-
152,Well I am an Apple lover . so many mouths and so many opinions . For me there is no one on earth who can challenge apple security system. APPLE is the best . Apple X is the best so far. waiting and dying to buy one for me.,positive,-,-,-,-
153,Thanks Apple,positive,-,-,-,-
154,wonderfull,positive,-,-,-,-
155,"8 plus has best cam in the market, this sounds very good for iPhone X!",-,-,-,positive,-
156,The best smartphone camera weâve ever tested,-,-,-,positive,-
157,Easily the ugliest phone ever made.,-,-,-,-,positive
158,"Regarding the screen, i believe it is the first of its kind in which the screen reaches all 4 corners evenly (even though it has a cutout up top) That is innovation in itself.",-,-,-,-,positive
159,top of the screen is totally ugly,-,-,-,-,negative
160,cool!,positive,-,-,-,-
161,I've actually done research on the back camera sensor size on the iPhone 10... and believe it is going to be a 1/2 inch camera sensor size... which is bigger than Samsung camera sensors and will put it ahead of Samsung cameras,-,-,-,-,-
162,These phones are so expensive....you can hardly eat when you finish purchase it.,-,-,negative,-,-
163,Undoubtedly iPhone X is a revolution in Apple history.It has to be added that Apple had no alternatives but joining a group of hi ends with new norms and criteria in smartdevice history,positive,-,-,-,-
164,"what i concern is not its camera, i know the camera is good overall",-,-,-,positive,-
165,"With Super AMOLED display, I think the battery life could last little longer compared to LCD displays. And with powerful A11 chip, multitasking could be more smoother.",-,positive,-,-,positive
166,"The A11 chip is super fast, even par with latest MacBook pro performance. this phone will be fresh for next 5 years (I derived this from my iPhone 5S bought 4 years back but still working great specifically super fast with latest iOS 11)",-,positive,-,-,-
167,Iphone x is awful phone,negative,-,-,-,-
168,"battery capacity..uhrmm..no thanks. im not just heavy user, im HARDCORE user.",-,negative,-,-,-
169,A great phone for whom who can afford it. I really don`t recommend just because of the price tag.,positive,-,negative,-,-
170,iPhone X is a superb piece of tech. Love the product. Bought mine from ajio website. had some cool offers on products,positive,-,-,-,-
171,Screen is amazing. Face detection works almost flawlessly for me. Battery is a non issue. Works all day. Love the new gestures. No home button is perfect. Sound from the Lightning Earbuds is the best from Apple by FAR!!! Anything negative is more than likely bashing IMHO.,-,positive,-,-,positive
172,Its contains lots of awesome features especially Face ID... Itâs just too cool.. I used to face finger print detection problem while driving car.... typing password while driving is just too risky.. which now donât bother me anymore,-,positive,-,-,-
173,"My only complaint is the price, Samsung and iPhone are amazing phones. one is good for this, the other one is good for that. stop the hate. but I do have to say that Apple is marking the price way to high.",-,-,negative,-,-
174,love this phone. Swipe up Home gesture is awesome.,-,positive,-,-,-

176,Apple Created the best display I ever seen in mobile phones .,-,-,-,-,positive

182,"Hi Guys, Just to let you'll know that i have bought the iPhone X and its just amazing",positive,-,-,-,-
183,FaceID works like a charm. I dont miss the home button much. I kind of like the notch as it divides the battery from the others notification to the left.,-,positive,-,-,-
184,I have the X and I'm not impressed.,negative,-,-,-,-
185,"In January, my iPhone X is going on eBay for sale. It's boring, the phone is several years behind its competitors technology. It's a phone for young people who don't know what the competition has. Yawn.",negative,-,-,-,-
186,"Really fast and fluid phone, which is to be expected at this price range, but still, the notch is in some people's opinion ugly. But people can always find something wrong with any product.",positive,-,positive,-,negative
187,Battery life with this is very good,-,positive,-,-,-
188,"it does have that notch,.it's not ideal.",-,-,-,-,negative
189,"Yeah,.there is no doubt the IPhone X is not the best IPhone to as regards to its capabilities ",positive,-,-,-,-
190,Great phone and Face Id works well....!!,positive,positive,-,-,-
191,Apple x not as well as we thought. Home button is the breath of apple apple 8 is good but older design is not acceptable. Basically apple 8 should have apple x design. Then it would be surely popular at every where. iOS 11 firmware should be improve with give option for direct call in third party dialer. It's very annoying ask confirmation call. Sometimes it's not good. Hope apple will update it sure.,-,-,-,-,-
192,Camera is almost real professional!!!,-,-,-,positive,-
193,Faceid is fast and the screen... omg the screen!!!!! Perfect!,-,-,-,-,positive
194,Best smartphone i ever had.,positive,-,-,-,-
195,nice phone,positive,-,-,-,-
196,"I like apple but what preventing me from spending so much money for this phone is the ""battery"". What would you do with a nice phone that would just last for half a day. I'm a heavy user",-,negative,-,-,-
197,Apple always put a iPhone with almost same features as all smartphone have but overpriced its phone ....we can also get Ai . Face recognition in other phones in about 15000 then why waste on iPhone,-,-,negative,-,-

205,Speed is well ... wow ... just like the iPad Pro 10.5. Cameras ... amazing for such a small device,-,positive,-,positive,-
206,I think the problem of iphone is the battery life if they can make it like 3600 Mah or 4000 it will be great,-,negative,-,-,-
207,The notch itself is stylish and looks cool. Apple tried to make something completely bezel-less,-,-,-,-,positive

215,The iPhone X is superior in many ways do a deep comparison,positive,-,-,-,-
216,"The A11 is a six-core, remember that adding dual-core to iPhone is not like adding dual-core laptops and requires a very accurate processor design.

230,"I know the phone are not just specs in a paper. But they are performances an measures inside that are reflected in those ""papers"". So stop saying stupid things and get over it,",-,positive,-,-,-
231,"I am very disappointed with apple this year, I bought an iphone x 256 gb on the 16th of this month and the Face ID cannot register my face or any other face and the selfie portrait mode is also not working.

Look at the iPhone 6, 6s, 6s Plus, 7, 7 Plus, 8. All the same design. It is not ugly, but a bit boring.

578,I've grew up on windows machines. Made the switch to mac so for music production and as such have been immersed in the apple ecosystem. My last phone was the iphone xs 64gb. I decided to buy the s10+ on a whim and have been thoroughly impressed with the samsung. I am honestly not impressed with the iphone 11. Sure iOS offers a slick user experience but its not enough to justify apple ignoring the clear advantage the current android flagship phones have in terms of specs.
